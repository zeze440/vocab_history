We are extended through artifacts like a knife or a drone, and they, in turn, are extended through human biology. It is not even correct to say that artifacts reverberate through ""us,"" as if they were different and separable from us. In critical ways we are them and they are us. That's why we die to defend a flag, risk death to dive for pearls, or be so involved in scientific or artistic works. Those phenomena do not necessarily represent sacrifices or dysfunction; they are typical of humans, and they clearly confound any simple Darwinian logic in the same way that a deer walking uphill confounds the logic of gravity."

In newborns, it’s no less than 65 percent. That’s partly why babies sleep all the time ? their growing brains exhaust them ? and have a lot of body fat, to use as an energy reserve when needed. Our muscles use even more of our energy, about a quarter of the total, but we have a lot of muscle. Actually, per unit of matter, the brain uses by far more energy than our other organs. That means that the brain is the most expensive of our organs. But it is also marvelously efficient. Our brains require only about four hundred calories of energy a day ? about the same as we get from a blueberry muffin. Try running your laptop for twenty-four hours on a muffin and see how far you get."
