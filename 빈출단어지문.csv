In Europe and the USA, increased rates of participation occurred in the decades after the Second World War. Between 2000 and 2014, rates of participation in higher education almost doubled from 19% to 34% across the world among the members of the population in the school-leaving age category (typically 18-23). The dramatic expansion of higher education has been marked by a wider range of institutions of higher learning and a more diverse demographic of students. Changes from an elite system to a mass higher education system are associated with political needs to build a specialized workforce for the economy. In theory, the expansion of higher education to develop a highly skilled workforce should diminish the role of examinations in the selection and control of students, initiating approaches to assessment which enable lifelong learning: assessment for learning and a focus on feedback for development. In reality, sociopolitical changes to expand higher education have set up a 'field of contradictions' for assessment in higher education. Mass higher education requires efficient approaches to assessment, such as examinations and multiple-choice quizzes, with minimalist, impersonal, or standardised feedback, often causing students to focus more on grades than feedback. In contrast, the relatively small numbers of students in elite systems in the past allowed for closer relationships between students and their teachers, with formative feedback shaping the minds, academic skills, and even the characters of students."

What are bird-watchers actually doing out there in the woods, swamps, and fields? The key to comprehending the passion of birding is to realize that bird-watching is really a hunt. But unlike hunting, the trophies you accumulate are in your mind. Of course, your mind is a great place to populate with them because you carry them around with you wherever you go. You don't leave them to gather dust on a wall or up in the attic. Your birding experiences become part of your life, part of who you are. And because birders are human, these birding memories ― like most human memories ― improve over time. The colors of the plumages become richer, the songs sweeter, and those elusive field marks more vivid and distinct in retrospect."

The first issue governments face in achieving national food security is the problem of insuring that adequate amounts of food are available to the resident population. Some governments have set goals of food self-sufficiency, which means most if not all of the food available in a country comes from the domestic farming system. However, food security does not require food self-sufficiency because countries can import food items not easily produced within the country. Agricultural products are, after all, highly sensitive to climatic, soil and other conditions that tend to vary around the world. Even countries with extremely productive agricultural sectors are not fully self-sufficient in all food items. The United States, for example, depends on imports for its supply of coffee, tea, bananas and other tropical products. In general, the problem of assuring adequate food supplies is solved by relying on both domestic production and imports."

A number of studies have been done to reveal what happens in healthy people’s brains when they go through something stressful. One study demonstrated a link between a smaller hippocampus and people who had experienced long-lasting stress. Why does this matter? This part of the brain helps you remain resilient in the face of stress and is involved in mood regulation. It also helps you to monitor the safety of your environment and store dangerous images in your long-term memory so you can avoid them in the future. It does all these things as part of its duties of regulating your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. But chronic stress can confuse the hippocampus and lead to turning signals for cortisol “on” instead of “off,” which can trap you in a constant state of fight, flight, or freeze."

A conjecture is a philosophical invention, cooked up rather mystically by the mind through the mental computation we call careful contemplation. However, until the hypothesis is tested against reality, it is not yet truly knowledge; it is just information that represents speculation. Knowledge is information that has demonstrated its usefulness. It is what is left over after cycles of experimental testing have eliminated false theories. As scientists continually test their hypotheses and modify their models to account for new and surprising data, a kind of “learning loop” emerges that statisticians call Bayesian updating. Based on Bayes’ Rule, developed by eighteenth-century English statistician and philosopher Thomas Bayes, Bayesian updating refers to a mathematical process whereby an accepted theory or predictive model gets increasingly accurate through the repetitive testing of competing variants of that theory."

Revolutionaries have always looked to the past to frame their future cause, as is amply illustrated by examples from nationalism to communism. The future has often been seen as variously a recovery of a lost time, as a replication of what is established, or as a model bequeathed by a heroic age long gone. The writing of history is based on understanding or explaining future outcomes that were not known to contemporaries, since the historian has the benefit of hindsight and the past is nothing more than the accumulation of futures that are now our past. So, rather than see the hand of the past always shaping the future, perhaps it can be seen in reverse, with the past — in the sense of our understanding of it — being shaped by our orientation to the future."

But the technological advances of suppliers made electric systems and electric motors ever more affordable and reliable, and the suppliers’ intensive marketing programs also sped the adoption of the new technology. Further accelerating the shift was the rapid expansion in the number of skilled electrical engineers, who provided the expertise needed to install and run the new systems. In short order, electric power had gone from exotic to commonplace.
But one thing didn’t change. Factories continued to build their own power-supply systems on their own premises. Few manufacturers considered buying electricity from the small central stations. Designed to supply lighting to local homes and shops, the central stations had neither the size nor the skill to serve the needs of big factories. And the factory owners, having always supplied their own power, were unwilling to assign such a critical function to an outsider. They knew that a glitch in power supply would bring their operations to a halt — and that a lot of glitches might well mean bankruptcy. As the new century began, a survey found that there were already 50,000 private electric plants in operation, far surpassing the 3,600 central stations."

You may ask your child “Why do you feel sad?” and she may not have a clue. As a child, she may not have an answer on the tip of her tongue. Maybe she’s feeling sad about her parents’ arguments, or because she feels overtired, or she’s worried about a piano recital. But she may or may not be able to explain any of this. And even when she does come up with an answer, she might be worried that the answer is not good enough to justify the feeling. Under these circumstances, a series of questions can just make a child silent. It’s better to simply reflect what you notice. You can say, “You seem a little tired today,” or, “I noticed that you frowned when I mentioned the recital,” and wait for her response."

But that challenge frequently inspires creative rerenderings that offer the prospect of a gain in translation as well. A washingmachine manual doesn’t present the same challenges, nor therefore does it inspire the same creativity either. But where, in terms of the opposition between literary and nonliterary language, might we position philosophy’s language? Might philosophy want to avoid a translatory economy that aims for a gain in translation but risks a loss? Philosophy wishes to convey its truths intact, without loss— and without gain either, or at least it might hesitate to offer its truths to translation without further clarification of what a gain, and indeed a gain in depth, actually means. It cannot be a matter of offsetting “stylistic losses.” The loss philosophy fears is a loss of meaning, the compromising of a truth. Thus, philosophy might prefer to be placed on the side of nonliterary language, and express itself in unstylish language, like Badiou’s mathematical writing, so that no translator is prompted to rude and bold acts of creative rewriting. If philosophy wishes to increase its range and avoid being restricted to a national or regional tradition, it needs a translation model that conveys philosophical truths to the world without any “economic” fluctuations of loss and gain."

Ironically, students with the greatest need to concentrate when studying are often the ones who surround themselves with the most distractions. These teenagers argue that they can study better with the TV or radio playing. Some professionals actually support their position. They argue that many teenagers can actually study productively under less-than-ideal conditions because they've been exposed repeatedly to ""background noise"" since early childhood. These educators argue that children have become used to the sounds of the TV, video games, and loud music. They also argue that insisting students turn off the TV or radio when doing homework will not necessarily improve their academic performance. This position is certainly not generally shared, however.

(Think about how hostile mammalian and avian vocalizations are built upon size bluffing through lowered pitch and noisy growling ― a ""dishonest signal."") According to Dawkins and Krebs, such false signaling is found in all animal communication: the colors flashed by butterflies, the calls of crickets, the pheromones released by moths and ants, the body postures of lizards, and our acoustic signals. Nature is deceitful. Creatures will do what they can to not die - at least until they've succeeded in winning a mate and passing along their genes. But at the same time, Dawkins and Krebs tell us, the receivers of deceptive signals undergo their own coevolutionary ""selection pressure"" for detecting false communications. The coevolution of voice and ear initiated a biological ""arms race."" The ""manipulating"" vocalizer evolves, over vast spans of evolutionary time, finer and finer means for faking, by acquiring greater neurological control over the vocal apparatus. Meanwhile, the listener, who has his own survival concerns, gets better at picking out the particular blend of pitch, rhythm, timbre and volume that marks the vocalizer as a deceiver. This compels the sender to further refine his ""manipulations,"" which creates further pressure on the receiver to improve his acoustic ""mindreading."""

They say people who go to sleep between these times have a lower risk of heart disease. Six years ago, the researchers collected data on the sleep patterns of 80,000 volunteers. The volunteers had to wear a special watch for seven days so the researchers could collect data on their sleeping and waking times. The scientists then monitored the health of the volunteers. Around 3,000 volunteers later showed heart problems. They went to bed earlier or later than the ideal 10p.m. to 11p.m. timeframe. One of the authors of the study, Dr. David Plans, commented on his research and the effects of bedtimes on the health of our heart. He said the study could not give a certain cause for their results, but it suggests that early or late bedtimes may be more likely to disrupt the body clock, with negative consequences for cardiovascular health. He said that it was important for our body to wake up to the morning light, and that the worst time to go to bed was after midnight because it may reduce the likelihood of seeing morning light which resets the body clock. He added that we risk cardiovascular disease if our body clock is not reset properly."

We spend about a year unable to walk, about two more before we can articulate full thoughts, and many more years unable to provide for ourselves. We are totally dependent on those around us for our survival. Now compare this to many other mammals. Dolphins, for instance, are born swimming; giraffes learn to stand within hours; a baby zebra can run within forty-five minutes of birth. Across the animal kingdom, our cousins are strikingly independent soon after they're born. On the face of it, that seems like a great advantage for other species ― but in fact it signifies a limitation. Baby animals develop quickly because their brains are wiring up according to a largely preprogrammed routine. But that preparedness trades off with flexibility. Imagine if some unfortunate rhinoceros found itself on the Arctic tundra, or on top of a mountain in the Himalayas, or in the middle of a metropolis. It would have no capacity to adapt (which is why we don't find rhinos in those areas). This strategy of arriving with a pre-arranged brain works inside a particular niche in the ecosystem ― but put an animal outside of that niche, and its chances of thriving are low. In contrast, humans are able to thrive in many different environments, from the frozen tundra to the high mountains to crowded urban centers. This is possible because the human brain is born remarkably incomplete. Instead of arriving with everything wired up ― let's call it ""hardwired"" ― a human brain allows itself to be shaped by the details of life experience. This leads to long periods of helplessness as the young brain slowly molds to its environment. It's ""livewired."""

In fact, most people are unaware of their personalities because from early childhood, they have spent most of their time adopting out-of-sync identities that completely mask their natural personalities. More often than not, the environments of our youth (for example, the way our parents raise us, the way society interacts with us, and the way our culture shapes us) mislead us as adults into thinking we are one kind of person － when we are really another! As children, we are surrounded by families and societies and cultures that are constantly making impressions on us, giving us feedback about how we should be in the world, and teaching us ""the right"" ways to behave, the ""right"" thoughts and feelings to have, and the ""right"" groups to join. Although we come into the world being one way (our personalities), we often receive messages over time, from these outside influences, that there are drawbacks to being our true selves and rewards for adopting identities that are out-of-sync with our true selves.

He discusses what he calls default assumptions. Default assumptions are preconceived notions about the likely state of affairs — what we assume to be true in the absence of specific information. Given no other information, when I mention ""secretary,"" you are likely to assume the secretary is a woman, because ""woman"" and ""secretary"" are associated stereotypically. In the absence of specific details, people rely on the stereotype as a default assumption for filling in the blanks. Default assumptions have a tendency, in Hofstadter's words, to ""permeate our mental representations and channel our thoughts."" For instance, given the words ""cat,"" ""dog,"" and ""chases,"" you are likely to think first of a dog chasing a cat. This line of thought reflects a default assumption that, all else being equal, the dog is more likely to chase the cat than the other way around. 
Default assumptions are rooted in our socially learned associative clusters and linguistic categories. They are useful in that people cannot always afford the time it would take to consider every theoretical possibility that confronts them. Nonetheless, default assumptions are often wrong. Default assumptions are only one type of language-based categorization. Hofstadter is particularly interested in race-based and gender-based categorization and default assumptions. For instance, if you hear that your school basketball team is playing tonight, do you assume it's the men's team? Most people would assume so unless a qualifier is added to provide specific information. In this case, the qualifier would be ""the women's basketball team is playing tonight."""

Surprisingly, this is not always the case. In group polarization, a period of discussion pushes group members to take more extreme positions in the direction that they were already inclined to prefer. Group polarization does not reverse the direction of attitudes, but rather accentuates the attitudes held at the beginning. Two pressures appear to push individuals to take more extreme positions following a group discussion. First, conformity and desire for affiliation contribute to group polarization. If the majority of a group is leaning in a particular direction, what could be a better way of fitting in than agreeing with that majority, and maybe even taking its argument one step farther? There is also a tendency for like-minded people to affiliate with one another, which can provide reinforcement for existing opinions, increase people’s confidence in those opinions, lead to the discovery of new reasons for those opinions and counterarguments to opposing views, and reduce exposure to conflicting ideas. Second, exposure to discussion on a topic introduces new reasons for maintaining an attitude. If you are already opposed to gun control and you listen to additional arguments supporting your position, you might end up more opposed than you were originally."

Transport is the source of only 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions within the food sector, so reducing the distance that food travels after it leaves the farm is far less important than reducing wasteful energy use on the farm. Food coming from a distance can actually be better for the climate, depending on how it was grown. For example, field-grown tomatoes shipped from Mexico in the winter months will have a smaller carbon footprint than local winter tomatoes grown in a greenhouse. In the United Kingdom, lamb meat that travels 11,000 miles from New Zealand generates only one-quarter the carbon emissions per pound compared to British lamb because farmers in the United Kingdom raise their animals on feed (which must be produced using fossil fuels) rather than on clover pastureland. When food does travel, what matters most is not the distance traveled but the travel mode (surface versus air), and most of all the load size. Bulk loads of food can travel halfway around the world by ocean freight with a smaller carbon footprint, per pound delivered, than foods traveling just a short distance but in much smaller loads. For example, 18-wheelers carry much larger loads than pickup trucks so they can move food 100 times as far while burning only one-third as much gas per pound of food delivered."

On the other hand, if we're not careful, we're likely to conduct an imbalanced analysis, falling prey to a cluster of errors collectively known as ""confirmation biases.""
For example, nearly all companies include classic ""tell me about yourself"" job interviews as part of the hiring process, and many rely on these interviews alone to evaluate applicants. But it turns out that traditional interviews are actually one of the least useful tools for predicting an employee's future success. This is because interviewers often subconsciously make up their minds about interviewees based on their first few moments of interaction and spend the rest of the interview cherry-picking evidence and phrasing their questions to confirm that initial impression: ""I see here you left a good position at your previous job. You must be pretty ambitious, right?"" versus ""You must not have been very committed, huh?"" This means that interviewers can be prone to overlooking significant information that would clearly indicate whether this candidate was actually the best person to hire. More structured approaches, like obtaining samples of a candidate's work or asking how he would respond to difficult hypothetical situations, are dramatically better at assessing future success, with a nearly threefold advantage over traditional interviews."

A basket of products is measured for inflation by price, not by volume or weight. If the products shrink in size but the price stays the same, technically no price increase has occurred. But people aren’t stupid, they know what that means. You can see this in everything from the reduced amount of cereal in a box to smaller-sized chocolate bars. You can see it in the form of ever-larger apertures in toothpaste tubes and powders of various sorts. The purpose of these changes is to make the consumer use up the product faster and to pay more per weight. Toilet paper and paper towel rolls have ever-larger tube centres and ever-fewer sheets, while the price remains the same. There are fewer potato crisps in the bag and cookies in the box. Bottles of liquids such as perfumes have ever-larger dimples on the bottom that displace the product and create the illusion of more inside than there is.

One example is color blindness. Most color blindness is associated with genes on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, so if this problem occurs on one of them, the other can compensate. But men have only one X chromosome. If the mutation occurs there, that male is color blind. We might ask why such a deficiency would survive and not die out. To understand this, we can consider ancient hunter-gatherers, with the men doing most of the hunting for meat and the women doing most of the gathering of fruits and nuts. Gathering fruits, especially berries, and nuts is much more productive if it is easy to distinguish the red or purple fruit from the green leaves of the plant. If red-green color blindness were common among women, the resulting lack of productivity would likely cause this trait to die out relatively quickly. On the other hand, the men out hunting don't much rely on being able to contrast red from green. Most of the animals they are hunting have fur or feathers that help them hide. Rather than relying on color, the hunter relies on an acute ability to detect motion. It is conceivable that a reduction in color contrast in these circumstances might actually enhance one's ability to detect subtle motions. Given that a hunted animal blends into its surroundings, less background color variation would be less of a visual distraction."

This was a period when knowledge was not spread widely, there were few books and most people could not read. As a consequence, knowledge passed down through the oral traditions of stories and shared experiences. And since older people had accumulated more knowledge, the social norm was that to be over fifty was to be wise. This social perception of age began to shift with the advent of new technologies such as the printing press. Over time, as more books were printed, literacy increased, and the oral traditions of knowledge transfer began to fade. With the fading of oral traditions, the wisdom of the old became less important and as a consequence being over fifty was no longer seen as signifying wisdom. We are living in a period when the gap between chronological and biological age is changing fast and where social norms are struggling to adapt. In a video produced by the AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons), young people were asked to do various activities ‘just like an old person’. When older people joined them in the video, the gap between the stereotype and the older people’s actual behaviour was striking. It is clear that in today’s world our social norms need to be updated quickly."

In this digital age, teens wire their brains to make these shifts very quickly, but they are still, like everyone else, paying attention to one thing at a time, sequentially. Common sense tells us multitasking should increase brain activity, but Carnegie Mellon University scientists using the latest brain imaging technology find it doesn't. As a matter of fact, they discovered that multitasking actually decreases brain activity. Neither task is done as well as if each were performed individually. Fractions of a second are lost every time we make a switch, and a person's interrupted task can take 50 percent longer to finish, with 50 percent more errors. Turns out the latest brain research supports the old advice ""one thing at a time.""
It's not that kids can't do some tasks simultaneously. But if two tasks are performed at once, one of them has to be familiar. Our brains perform a familiar task on ""automatic pilot"" while really paying attention to the other one. That's why insurance companies consider talking on a cell phone and driving to be as dangerous as driving while drunk — it's the driving that goes on ""automatic pilot"" while the conversation really holds our attention. Our kids may be living in the Information Age but our brains have not been redesigned yet."

However, that is not a realistic option for scientists who feel a strong sense of responsibility to inform the public and policymakers and/or to offer suggestions. Speaking with members of the media has advantages in getting a message out and perhaps receiving favorable recognition, but it runs the risk of misinterpretations, the need for repeated clarifications, and entanglement in never-ending controversy. Hence, the decision of whether to speak with the media tends to be highly individualized. Decades ago, it was unusual for Earth scientists to have results that were of interest to the media, and consequently few media contacts were expected or encouraged. In the 1970s, the few scientists who spoke frequently with the media were often criticized by their fellow scientists for having done so. The situation now is quite different, as many scientists feel a responsibility to speak out because of the importance of global warming and related issues, and many reporters share these feelings. In addition, many scientists are finding that they enjoy the media attention and the public recognition that comes with it. At the same time, other scientists continue to resist speaking with reporters, thereby preserving more time for their science and avoiding the risk of being misquoted and the other unpleasantries associated with media coverage."

There is no law that forces you to say Thank you. But if people don't say Thank you in these cases it is marked. People expect that you will say it. You become responsible. Failing to say it will be both surprising and worthy of criticism. Not knowing the norms of another community is the central problem of cross-cultural communication. To continue the Thank you example, even though another culture may have an expression that appears translatable (many don't), there may be different norms for its usage, for example, such that you should say Thank you only when the cost someone has caused is considerable. In such a case it would sound ridiculous (i.e., unexpected, surprising, and worthy of criticism) if you were to thank someone for something so minor as holding a door open for you."

Negotiators often approach integrative negotiation opportunities as zero-sum situations or win-lose exchanges. Those who believe in the mythical fixed pie assume that parties' interests stand in opposition, with no possibility for integrative settlements and mutually beneficial trade-offs, so they suppress efforts to search for them. In a hiring negotiation, a job applicant who assumes that salary is the only issue may insist on $75,000 when the employer is offering $70,000. Only when the two parties discuss the possibilities further do they discover that moving expenses and starting date can also be negotiated, which may facilitate resolution of the salary issue.
The tendency to see negotiation in fixed-pie terms varies depending on how people view the nature of a given conflict situation. This was shown in a clever experiment by Harinck, de Dreu, and Van Vianen involving a simulated negotiation between prosecutors and defense lawyers over jail sentences. Some participants were told to view their goals in terms of personal gain (e.g., arranging a particular jail sentence will help your career), others were told to view their goals in terms of effectiveness (a particular sentence is most likely to prevent recidivism), and still others were told to focus on values (a particular jail sentence is fair and just). Negotiators focusing on personal gain were most likely to come under the influence of fixed-pie beliefs and approach the situation competitively. Negotiators focusing on values were least likely to see the problem in fixed-pie terms and more inclined to approach the situation cooperatively. Stressful conditions such as time constraints contribute to this common misperception, which in turn may lead to less integrative agreements."

Other times, we know we remember something, but we don’t recognize that we learned it in school. Knowing where and when you learned something is usually called context information, and context is handled by different memory processes than memory for the content. Thus, it’s quite possible to retain content without remembering the context. For example, if someone mentions a movie and you think to yourself that you heard it was terrible but can’t remember where you heard that, you’re recalling the content, but you’ve lost the context. Context information is frequently easier to forget than content, and it’s the source of a variety of memory illusions. For instance, people are unconvinced by a persuasive argument if it’s written by someone who is not very credible (e.g., someone with a clear financial interest in the topic). But in time, readers’ attitudes, on average, change in the direction of the persuasive argument. Why? Because readers are likely to remember the content of the argument but forget the source ― someone who is not credible. If remembering the source of knowledge is difficult, you can see how it would be easy to conclude you don’t remember much from school."

A chief or group of elders usually led the camp or village. Most of these leaders had to hunt and gather along with the other members because the surpluses of food and other vital resources were seldom sufficient to support a full-time chief or village council. The development of agriculture changed work patterns. Early farmers could reap 3-10 kg of grain from each 1 kg of seed planted. Part of this food/energy surplus was returned to the community and provided support for nonfarmers such as chieftains, village councils, men who practice medicine, priests, and warriors. In return, the nonfarmers provided leadership and security for the farming population, enabling it to continue to increase food/energy yields and provide ever larger surpluses.
With improved technology and favorable conditions, agriculture produced consistent surpluses of the basic necessities, and population groups grew in size. These groups concentrated in towns and cities, and human tasks specialized further. Specialists such as carpenters, blacksmiths, merchants, traders, and sailors developed their skills and became more efficient in their use of time and energy. The goods and services they provided brought about an improved quality of life, a higher standard of living, and, for most societies, increased stability."

Managing people is about being aware of their unique personalities. It's also about empathy and adaptability, and knowing how the things you do and say will be interpreted and adapting accordingly. Who you are and what you say may not be the same from one person to the next. For instance, if you're asking someone to work a second weekend in a row, or telling them they aren't getting that deserved promotion just yet, you need to bear in mind the individual. Vincent will have a very different reaction to the news than Emily, and they will each be more receptive to the news if it's bundled with different things. Perhaps that promotion news will land easier if Vincent is given a few extra vacation days for the holidays, while you can promise Emily a bigger promotion a year from now. Consider each person's complex positive and negative personality traits, their life circumstances, and their mindset in the moment when deciding what to say and how to say it. Personal connection, compassion, and an individualized management style are key to drawing consistent, rock star‐level work out of everyone."

In other words, the reason it can be difficult to remember what you ate for breakfast two Thursdays ago is that there was probably nothing special about that Thursday or that particular breakfast ― consequently, all your breakfast memories combine together into a sort of generic impression of a breakfast. Your memory merges similar events not only because it's more efficient to do so, but also because this is fundamental to how we learn things ― our brains extract abstract rules that tie experiences together.
This is especially true for things that are routine. If your breakfast is always the same ― cereal with milk, a glass of orange juice, and a cup of coffee for instance ― there is no easy way for your brain to extract the details from one particular breakfast. Ironically, then, for behaviors that are routinized, you can remember the generic content of the behavior (such as the things you ate, since you always eat the same thing), but particulars to that one instance can be very difficult to call up (such as the sound of a garbage truck going by or a bird that passed by your window) unless they were especially distinctive. On the other hand, if you did something unique that broke your routine―perhaps you had leftover pizza for breakfast and spilled tomato sauce on your dress shirt ― you are more likely to remember it."

It's time to restructure the way you think. Underlying this narration are the beliefs that frame your experience and give it meaning. Think of your beliefs as having many layers.
On the surface are your automatic thoughts. These are like short tapes that momentarily flash through your mind. Call these automatic thoughts a form of ""self-talk"" that you use as you navigate through the day. You produce a wide variety of these automatic thoughts, some consciously and some unconsciously. For example, automatic thoughts that fuel anxiety go something like this: You walk into a room, see a few new people, and say to yourself, ""Oh no, I don't like this. This is not good."" Or, ""These people will soon find out that I am full of anxiety and will reject me."" Automatic thoughts are bad habits that cloud fresh and positive experiences. They can turn a potentially good experience into one fraught with anxiety. If you tell yourself that you are always stressed or full of anxiety before doing something new, that new experience will be tainted by that anxiety."

With each round of genome copying, errors accumulate. This is similar to alterations in medieval books. Each time a copy was made by hand, some changes were introduced accidentally; as changes stacked up, the copies may have acquired meanings at variance with the original. Similarly, genomes that have undergone more copying processes will have gathered more mistakes. To make things worse, mutations may damage genes responsible for error checking and repair of genomes, further accelerating the introduction of mutations. Most genome mutations do not have any noticeable effects. It is just like changing the i for a y in ""kingdom"" would not distort the word's readability. But sometimes a mutation to a human gene results in, for example, an eye whose iris is of two different colors. Similarly, almost everyone has birthmarks, which are due to mutations that occurred as our body's cells multiplied to form skin. If mutations are changes to the genome of one particular cell, how can a patch of cells in an iris or a whole patch of skin, consisting of many individual cells, be affected simultaneously? The answer lies in the cell lineage, the developmental history of a tissue from particular cells through to their fully differentiated state. If the mutation occurred early on in the lineage of the developing iris, then all cells in that patch have inherited that change."

The beneficial effects of familiar structure on memory have been observed for many types of expertise, including music. People with musical training can reproduce short sequences of musical notation more accurately than those with no musical training when notes follow conventional sequences, but the advantage is much reduced when the notes are ordered randomly. Expertise also improves memory for sequences of movements.

Interestingly, this could be similar to the way humor works: a 'safe threat' that causes pleasure by playfully violating norms. We feel uncomfortable, but safe. In this context, where survival is clearly not in danger, the desire for pain is actually the desire for a reward, not suffering or punishment. This reward-like effect comes from the feeling of mastery over the pain. The closer you look at your chilli-eating habit, the more remarkable it seems. When the active ingredient of chillies — capsaicin — touches the tongue, it stimulates exactly the same receptor that is activated when any of these tissues are burned. Knowing that our body is firing off danger signals, but that we are actually completely safe, produces pleasure. All children start off hating chilli, but many learn to derive pleasure from it through repeated exposure and knowing that they will never experience any real danger. Interestingly, seeking pain for the pain itself appears to be uniquely human.

McGraw continued to point, calling each player out, until he was satisfied with the rearrangement. ""Okay, this is how it's going to be,"" he began. ""We need to learn how to trust and work with each other. This is how a team plays. This is how I want you to be on and off the field: together."" The players looked at each other. Almost immediately, McGraw noticed a change in their postures and faces. He saw some of them starting to smile.
'Wow,' thought Wylder. From his new location on the grass, he stretched out his legs. He liked what he was hearing. A new sense of team spirit came across him, a deeper sense of connection. It was encouraging to hear Coach talk about this, to see him face the challenge head‐on. Now his speech was over. The players got up and started walking on the field to warm up. ""Good job, Coach. That was good,"" Wylder said to McGraw in a low voice as he walked past him, keeping his eyes down out of respect."

One morning, she noticed that Leo was not feeling well. Concerned for her beloved cat, Christine decided to take him to the animal hospital. As she always brought Leo to this hospital, she was certain that the vet knew well about Leo. She desperately hoped Leo got the necessary care as soon as possible.
The waiting room was filled with other pet owners. Finally, it was Leo's turn to see the vet. Christine watched as the vet gently examined him. The vet said, ""I think Leo has a minor infection."" ""Infection? Will he be okay?"" asked Christine. ""We need to do some tests to see if he is infected. But for the tests, it's best for Leo to stay here,"" replied the vet. It was heartbreaking for Christine to leave Leo at the animal hospital, but she had to accept it was for the best.
""I'll call you with updates as soon as we know anything,"" said the vet. Throughout the day, Christine anxiously awaited news about Leo. Later that day, the phone rang and it was the vet. ""The tests revealed a minor infection. Leo needs some medication and rest, but he'll be back to his playful self soon."" Relieved to hear the news, Christine rushed back to the animal hospital to pick up Leo.
The vet provided detailed instructions on how to administer the medication and shared tips for a speedy recovery. Back at home, Christine created a comfortable space for Leo to rest and heal. She patted him with love and attention, ensuring that he would recover in no time. As the days passed, Leo gradually regained his strength and playful spirit."

At the beginning of her career she was hissed off a Vienna stage by the friends of her rival, Amelia. But in spite of this defeat, Henrietta endured until all Europe was at her feet.
Many years later, when Henrietta was at the height of her fame, one day she was riding through the streets of Berlin. Soon she came across a little girl leading a blind woman. She was touched by the woman's helplessness, and she impulsively beckoned the child to her, saying ""Come here, my child. Who is that you are leading by the hand?""
The answer was, ""That's my mother, Amelia Steininger. She used to be a great singer, but she lost her voice, and she cried so much about it that now she can't see anymore."" Henrietta inquired their address and then told the child, ""Tell your mother an old acquaintance will call on her this afternoon."" She searched out their place and undertook the care of both mother and daughter. At her request, a skilled doctor tried to restore Amelia's sight, but it was in vain.
But Henrietta's kindness to her former rival did not stop here. The next week she gave a benefit concert for the poor woman, and it was said that on that occasion Henrietta sang as she had never sung before.

Emma turned to Clara with a question, “Do you think this will be your favorite ride ever?” Clara’s face lit up with a bright smile as she nodded. “Definitely! I can’t wait to ride while watching those beautiful waves!” Emma and Clara jumped on their bikes and started to pedal toward the white cliff where the beach road ended. Speeding up and enjoying the wide blue sea, Emma couldn’t hide her excitement and exclaimed, “Clara, the view is amazing!” Clara’s silence, however, seemed to say that she was lost in her thoughts. Emma understood the meaning of her silence. Watching Clara riding beside her, Emma thought about Clara’s past tragedy, which she now seemed to have overcome. Clara used to be a talented swimmer, but she had to give up her dream of becoming an Olympic medalist in swimming because of shoulder injuries. Yet she responded to the hardship in a constructive way. After years of hard training, she made an incredible recovery and found a new passion for bike riding. Emma saw how the painful past made her maturer and how it made her stronger in the end. One hour later, Clara, riding ahead of Emma, turned back and shouted, “Look at the white cliff!” When they reached their destination, Emma and Clara stopped their bikes. Emma approached Clara, saying “Bicycle riding is unlike swimming, isn’t it?” Clara answered with a smile, “Quite similar, actually. Just like swimming, riding makes me feel truly alive.” She added, “It shows me what it means to live while facing life’s tough challenges.” Emma nodded in agreement and suggested, “Your first beach bike ride was a great success.

His two older brothers fit in easily and seemed to enjoy their work. But Jack was bored with the insurance industry. “It was worse than being bored,” he said. “I felt like I was dying inside.” Jack felt drawn to hair styling and dreamed of owning a hair shop with a lively environment. He was sure that he would enjoy the creative and social aspects of it and that he’d be successful. When he was twenty-six, Jack approached his father and expressed his intentions of leaving the business to become a hairstylist. As Jack anticipated, his father raged and accused Jack of being selfish, ungrateful, and unmanly. In the face of his father’s fury, Jack felt confusion and fear. His resolve became weak. But then a force filled his chest and he stood firm in his decision. In following his path, Jack not only ran three flourishing hair shops, but also helped his clients experience their inner beauty by listening and encouraging them when they faced dark times. His love for his work led to donating time and talent at nursing homes, which in turn led to becoming a hospice volunteer, and eventually to starting fundraising efforts for the hospice program in his community. And all this laid a strong stepping stone for another courageous move in his life. When, after having two healthy children of their own, Jack and his wife, Michele, decided to bring an orphaned child into their family, his father threatened to disown them. Jack understood that his father feared adoption, in this case especially because the child was of a different racial background than their family. Jack and Michele risked rejection and went ahead with the adoption. It took years but eventually Jack’s father loved the little girl and accepted his son’s independent choices. Jack realized that, although he often felt fear and still does, he has always had courage. In fact, courage was the scaffolding around which he had built richness into his life."

When the plane hit a bit of turbulence, the instructor pushed a hidden button. Suddenly, all the monitors inside the plane flashed several times then went out completely! Now the student was in control of an airplane that was flying well, but she had no indication of where she was or where she should go. She did have a map, but no other instruments. She was at a loss and then the plane shook again.

His two big ears, his four furry feet and his cute round nose were all frosty white, leaving him feeling ordinary and sad. Unlike the cheerful and contented pandas around him, he desired to be distinctive, special, and unique. Driven by the desire for uniqueness, the little panda sought inspiration from his distant cousin, a giant white panda covered with heavenly black patches. But the cousin revealed the patches were from an unintended encounter with mud, and he disliked them. Disappointed, the little panda walked home. On his way, he met a red-feathered peacock, who explained he turned red from eating wild berries. The little panda changed his path and hurried to the nearest berry bush, greedily eating a mouthful of juicy red berries. However, they were so bitter he couldn't swallow even one. At dusk, he finally got home and slowly climbed his favorite bamboo tree. There, he discovered a strange black and red flower with a sweet scent that tempted him to eat all its blossoms. The following morning, under sunny skies,　the little panda felt remarkably better. During breakfast, he found the other pandas chatting enthusiastically and asked why. They burst into laughter, exclaiming, ""Look at yourself!"" Glancing down, he discovered his once white fur was now stained jet black and glowing red. He was overjoyed and realized that, rather than by imitating others, his wishes can come true from unexpected places and genuine experiences."

The poet accepted the invitation and decided to attend. On the day of the wedding, the rich merchant, the host of the wedding, was receiving the guests at the gate. Many rich people of the town attended the wedding. They had come out in their best clothes. The poet wore simple clothes which were neither grand nor expensive.

Seeing all this, the poet quietly left the party and went to a shop where he could rent clothes. There he chose a richly decorated coat, which made him look like a new person. With this coat, he entered the party and this time was welcomed with open arms. The host embraced him as he would do to an old friend and complimented him on the clothes he was wearing. The poet did not say a word and allowed the host to lead him to the dining room. The host personally led the poet to his seat and served out chicken soup to him.

The philosopher's thirst for knowledge is shown through attempts to find better answers to questions even if those answers are never found. At the same time, a philosopher also knows that being too sure can hinder the discovery of other and better possibilities. In a philosophical dialogue, the participants are aware that there are things they do not know or understand. The goal of the dialogue is to arrive at a conception that one did not know or understand beforehand. In traditional schools, where philosophy is not present, students often work with factual questions, they learn specific content listed in the curriculum, and they are not required to solve philosophical problems. However, we know that awareness of what one does not know can be a good way to acquire knowledge. Knowledge and understanding are developed through thinking and talking. Putting things into words makes things clearer. Therefore, students must not be afraid of saying something wrong or talking without first being sure that they are right."

Certainly, such a computation does not generally have as its purpose its own survival and well-being. It does not, in general, assign value to the inputs. Compare, for example, a computer algorithm with the waggle dance of the honeybee, by which means a foraging bee conveys to others in the hive information about the source of food (such as nectar) it has located. The ""dance"" ― a series of stylized movements on the comb ― shows the bees how far away the food is and in which direction. But this input does not simply program other bees to go out and look for it. Rather, they evaluate this information, comparing it with their own knowledge of the surroundings. Some bees might not bother to make the journey, considering it not worthwhile. The input, such as it is, is processed in the light of the organism's own internal states and history; there is nothing prescriptive about its effects."

In a study where children heard another child in distress, young children (kindergarten through second grade) were more likely to help the child in distress when with another child than when alone. But for older children ― in fourth and sixth grade ― the effect reversed: they were less likely to help a child in distress when they were with a peer than when they were alone. Staub suggested that younger children might feel more comfortable acting when they have the company of a peer, whereas older children might feel more concern about being judged by their peers and fear feeling embarrassed by overreacting. Staub noted that ""older children seemed to discuss the distress sounds less and to react to them less openly than younger children."" In other words, the older children were deliberately putting on a poker face in front of their peers."

But his Grade 1 teacher was a wonderful, caring person who took the time to ask why Benjamin behaved the way he did. The teacher was determined to understand Benjamin and to accept him as he was.

I couldn't go for a couple of days and was concerned I'd missed the opportunity. When I finally went to the school, his teacher told me that the sale had ended but that the library had saved the book for my little boy. I suspected the teacher had paid for it out of his own pocket. It was a storyboard book with a place for a photo. On each page there was an outline of an animal and a hole so that the face in the photo appeared to be the face of the animal. Wondering if Benjamin would really be interested in the book, I brought it home. He loved it!

A study was conducted that explored what impact it has on employees. Results from the study indicate that participants who listen to rhythmic music were inclined to cooperate more irrespective of factors like age, gender, and academic background, compared to those who listened to less rhythmic music. This positive boost in the participants' willingness to cooperate was induced regardless of whether they liked the music or not. When people are in a more positive state of mind, they tend to become more agreeable and creative, while those on the opposite spectrum tend to focus on their individual problems rather than giving attention to solving group problems. The rhythm of music has a strong pull on people's behavior. This is because when people listen to music with a steady pulse, they tend to match their actions to the beat. This translates to better teamwork when making decisions because everyone is following one tempo."

This is the question all stories ask. It emerges first at the ignition point. When the initial change strikes, the protagonist overreacts or behaves in an otherwise unexpected way. We sit up, suddenly attentive. Who is this person who behaves like this? The question then re-emerges every time the protagonist is challenged by the plot and compelled to make a choice. Everywhere in the narrative that the question is present, the reader or viewer will likely be engaged. Where the question is absent, and the events of drama move out of its narrative beam, they are at risk of becoming detached ― perhaps even bored.

During the 1950s, Bowlby briefly worked as a mental health consultant for the World Health Organization. His attachment theory has been described as the dominant approach to understanding early social development."

Delk and Fillenbaum asked participants to match the color of figures with the color of their background. Some of the figures depicted objects associated with a particular color. These included typically red objects such as an apple, lips, and a symbolic heart. Other objects were presented that are not usually associated with red, such as a mushroom or a bell. However, all the figures were made out of the same red-orange cardboard. Participants then had to match the figure to a background varying from dark to light red. They had to make the background color match the color of the figures. The researchers found that red-associated objects required more red in the background to be judged a match than did the objects that are not associated with the color red. This implies that the cognitive association of objects to color influences how we perceive that color."

Say, for instance, a shopkeeper who realizes he is losing exchange opportunities because of his dishonest behavior may begin to act as if he were a kind and honest man in order to garner more business. He is persuaded to behave in an appropriate way, yet his actions may be insincere. While it is socially beneficial that he at least pretends to behave in this way, he may not actually become more virtuous. However, in order to maintain this status in his community and succeed in his business long term, he must continue to behave in this manner. Over time, it is likely that his once intentional actions will become instinctive and more genuine, and eventually result in actual moral development. Stated another way, a truly dishonest and conniving person is unlikely to convincingly pretend to be reputable for an extended period of time without being impacted by some sort of moral development."

Instruction in mathematics skills in isolation and devoid of student understandings and identities renders them helpless to benefit from explicit instruction. Thus, we agree that explicit instruction benefits students but propose that incorporating culturally relevant pedagogy and consideration of nonacademic factors that promote learning and mastery must enhance explicit instruction in mathematics instruction. Furthermore, teachers play a critical role in developing environments that encourage student identities, agency, and independence through discourses and practices in the classroom. Students who are actively engaged in a contextualized learning process are in control of the learning process and are able to make connections with past learning experiences to foster deeper and more meaningful learning."

Its flowing and sparkling stream of images, its compelling pace and natural rhythms, and its pictorial style are all part of this nonverbal language. So it follows naturally that the aesthetic quality and dramatic power of the image are extremely important to the overall quality of a film. Although the nature and quality of the story, editing, musical score, sound effects, dialogue, and acting can do much to enhance a film's power, even these important elements cannot save a film whose images are mediocre or poorly edited. As important as the quality of the image may be, however, it must not be considered so important that the purpose of the film as an artistic, unified whole is ignored. A film's photographic effects should not be created for their own sake as independent, beautiful, or powerful images. In the final analysis, they must be justified psychologically and dramatically, as well as aesthetically, as important means to an end, not as ends in themselves. Creating beautiful images for the sake of creating beautiful images violates a film's aesthetic unity and may actually work against the film."

As long as an ant displays the correct emblem (as long as she smells right, which requires that she have the right combination of molecules known as hydrocarbons on her body), her colony-mates admit her as one of their own. The scent is like a flag pin, one that every ant must wear. An ant that shouldn't be there is quickly detected by her alien scent.

It's not that ants are particularly fond of flowers ― at least, they are not attracted by their aesthetic qualities. Ants are motivated by their desire to eat them, and their interest is triggered when forget-me-nots form their seeds. The seeds are designed to make an ant's mouth water, for attached to the outside is a structure called an elaiosome, which looks like a tiny bit of cake. This fat-and sugar-rich treat is like chips and chocolate to an ant. The tiny creatures quickly carry the seeds back to their nest, where the colony is waiting eagerly in the tunnels for the calorie boost. The tasty treat is bitten off and the seed itself is discarded. Along come the trash collectors in the form of worker ants, which dispose of the seeds in the neighborhood ― carrying them up to 200 feet away from home base. Wild strawberries and other plants also benefit from this distribution service: ants are nature's gardeners, as it were."

Their lineage is visible in their calculus-based names, in adjectives like differential and integral and analytic, as in differential geometry, integral equations, and analytic number theory. These advanced branches of mathematics are like the many branches and species of multicellular life. In this analogy, the microbes of mathematics are the earliest topics: numbers, shapes, and word problems. Like unicellular organisms, they dominated the mathematical scene for most of its history.

Charles and Carstensen review a considerable body of evidence indicating that, as people get older, they tend to prioritize close social relationships, focus more on achieving emotional well-being, and attend more to positive emotional information while ignoring negative information. These changing motivational goals in old age have implications for attention to and processing of social cues from the environment. Of particular importance in considering emotional changes in old age is the presence of a positivity bias: that is, a tendency to notice, attend to, and remember more positive compared to negative information. The role of life experience in social skills also indicates that older adults might show gains in some aspects of social perception."

We know that some sport followers are so passionate about players, teams and the sport itself that their interest borders on obsession. This addiction provides the emotional glue that binds fans to teams, and maintains loyalty even in the face of on-field failure. While most managers can only dream of having customers that are as passionate about their products as sport fans, the emotion triggered by sport can also have a negative impact. Sport's emotional intensity can mean that organisations have strong attachments to the past through nostalgia and club tradition. As a result, they may ignore efficiency, productivity and the need to respond quickly to changing market conditions. For example, a proposal to change club colours in order to project a more attractive image may be defeated because it breaks a link with tradition."

They are predictable based on the past: what an animal's ancestors needed is likely to be what that animal also needs. Taste preferences, therefore, can be hardwired. Consider sodium (Na). The bodies of terrestrial vertebrates, including those of mammals, tend to have a concentration of sodium nearly fifty times that of the primary producers on land, plants. This is, in part, because vertebrates evolved in the sea and so evolved cells dependent upon the ingredients that were common in the sea, including sodium. To remedy the difference between their needs for sodium and that available in plants, herbivores can eat fifty times more plant material than they otherwise need (and eliminate the excess). Or they can seek out other sources of sodium. The salt taste receptor rewards animals for doing the latter, seeking out salt in order to satisfy their great need."

In a region in Western Australia, for instance, up to 90 percent of live coral was lost when ocean water temperatures rose, causing what scientists call coral bleaching. Yet in some sections of the reef surface, 44 percent of the corals recovered within twelve years.

One example is color blindness. Most color blindness is associated with genes on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, so if this problem occurs on one of them, the other can compensate. But men have only one X chromosome. If the mutation occurs there, that male is color blind. We might ask why such a deficiency would survive and not die out. To understand this, we can consider ancient hunter-gatherers, with the men doing most of the hunting for meat and the women doing most of the gathering of fruits and nuts. Gathering fruits, especially berries, and nuts is much more productive if it is easy to distinguish the red or purple fruit from the green leaves of the plant. If red-green color blindness were common among women, the resulting lack of productivity would likely cause this trait to die out relatively quickly. On the other hand, the men out hunting don't much rely on being able to contrast red from green. Most of the animals they are hunting have fur or feathers that help them hide. Rather than relying on color, the hunter relies on an acute ability to detect motion. It is conceivable that a reduction in color contrast in these circumstances might actually enhance one's ability to detect subtle motions. Given that a hunted animal blends into its surroundings, less background color variation would be less of a visual distraction."

One possibility is that it is an advantageous adaptive state of decreased metabolism for an animal when there are no more pressing activities. This seems true for deeper states of inactivity such as hibernation during the winter when there are few food supplies, and a high metabolic cost to maintaining adequate temperature. It may be true in daily situations as well, for instance for a prey species to avoid predators after dark. On the other hand, the apparent universality of sleep, and the observation that mammals such as cetaceans have developed such highly complex mechanisms to preserve sleep on at least one side of the brain at a time, suggests that sleep additionally provides some vital service(s) for the organism. This is particularly true since one aspect of sleep is decreased responsiveness to the environment. If sleep is universal even when this potential price must be paid, the implication may be that it has important functions that cannot be obtained just by quiet, wakeful resting."

That is, critics and laypeople alike could obtain new music simultaneously.

Limiting your time on tasks may sound like it will add more stress to your day, but it will actually have the opposite effect; when you impose deadlines on your tasks, you will be able to better focus on what needs to get done at any given moment, clearly defining your work schedule for the day. Set a challenging time limit to your task and play with it ― turn completing the task into a competition against the clock so that you can have a greater sense of accomplishment as you work towards the task at hand. If you complete your challenge, try reducing the amount of time you give yourself the next time you have to do something similar; this internal competition will help motivate you to focus more on your tasks, making you more productive in the long run."

As the coordinator, it is becoming apparent to me that the budget, previously approved by your department, needs some adjustments in order to meet the emerging modifications. Since my department has hired three more interns than planned initially, the most expensive need is for additional funding to cover their wages, training costs, and materials. I kindly request an additional budget allocation for these expenses. Please refer to the attachment for details. Thank you for your attention. Best regards, Matt Perry"

Therefore, making decisions, even qualitatively, is not possible without using mathematics and critical thinking.

How would you feel? Undoubtedly, there is something praiseworthy about the action. You’d be pleased to receive the gift. You’d say ‘thank you’, and mean it. But his change of heart is not entirely satisfying. According to Zagzebski, an American philosopher, he is not really generous. When we praise someone’s character, we use words for various virtues: ‘generous’, ‘kind’, ‘courageous’, etc. A person who gives one gift isn’t generous. Instead, generosity is a stable part of a person’s ‘moral identity’, an emotional habit that is part of who you are. Thus virtues, as opposed to nontypical impulse, are the result of your personal history. They are part of who you are, as they are part of how your character was formed. Instant virtue is therefore impossible. Popping a pill cannot make you a better person."

Things get much more complicated if I want to know the mass of a distant star. How do I measure it? We can roughly say that measuring the mass of a star involves various theories. If we want to measure the mass of a binary star, we first determine a center of mass between the two stars, then their distance from that center which we can then use, together with a value for the period and a certain instance of Kepler’s Third Law, to calculate the mass. In other words, in order to “measure” the star mass, we measure other quantities and use those values, together with certain equations, to calculate the mass. Measurement is not a simple and unmediated estimation of independently existing properties, but a determination of certain magnitudes before the background of a number of accepted theories."

Plants not only ""follow the sun"" by bending their stems, they also align their leaves in such a way as to maximize exposure to light and thereby promote growth. Some plants actually anticipate sunrise from ""memory,"" and even when deprived of solar signals retain this information for several days. In Brilliant Green, Stefano Mancuso and Alessandra Viola argue that plants possess not only the senses of sight, touch, smell, and hearing, but more than a dozen other sensory capacities that humans lack. For example, the roots of plants sense the mineral and water content of the soil and alter their direction of growth accordingly. Some are reluctant to label plant movements as behaviors, since they lack nerves and muscles. But just as they are able to breathe without lungs and digest nutrients without a stomach, plants have the ability to move (behave). We should not dismiss the existence of behavioral capacities in an organism simply because it lacks the physiological mechanism that is responsible for the behavior in animals. Plants clearly sense the environment, learn, store information, and use that information to guide movements; they behave. One might say that there is certain ""intelligence"" to their behavior. This is true as long as intelligence is defined in terms of the ability to solve problems through behavioral interactions with the environment, rather than with respect to mental capacity."

Physically, animal cartoon characters and toys made after animals are also most often deformed in such a way as to resemble humans. This is achieved by showing them with humanlike facial features and deformed front legs to resemble human hands. In more recent animated movies the trend has been to show the animals in a more ""natural"" way. However, they still use their front legs like human hands (for example, lions can pick up and lift small objects with one paw), and they still talk with an appropriate facial expression. A general strategy that is used to make the animal characters more emotionally appealing, both to children and adults, is to give them enlarged and deformed childlike features."

Although a solo male typically initiates a hunt, others often join in, and hunting success is much higher when chimps hunt as a group rather than individually. During the hunt, chimpanzees adopt different roles: one male might flush the monkeys from their refuge, while another blocks the escape route. Somewhere else, an ambusher hides, ready to make his deadly move. Although this sounds a lot like teamwork, recent work offers a simpler interpretation. Chimps are more likely to join others for hunts because larger hunting groups increase each individual's chance of catching a monkey — they aren't interested in collective goals. The appearance of specialised roles in the hunt may also be an illusion: a simpler explanation is that each chimp places himself where his own chance of catching a monkey is highest, relative to the positions the others have already taken. Collaboration in chimps seems to emerge from an 'every chimp for himself' mentality."

Nor were religious principles and ecclesiastic dogma their guiding lights. Rather, they took their lead from reason ― what some thinkers called ""the light of nature"" ― and experience. Whether they proceeded according to the logic of deduction or through the analysis of empirical data, the modern scientific method they developed consists in testing theories according to reason and in light of the available evidence."

What can make the difference is drive ― utilizing the mental gear to maximize gains made in the technical and physical areas. Drive provides direction (goals), sustains effort (motivation), and creates a training mindset that goes beyond simply working hard. Drive applies direct force on your physical and technical gears, strengthening and polishing them so they can spin with vigor and purpose. While desire might make you spin those gears faster and harder as you work out or practice, drive is what built them in the first place."

Self-driving cars, where a person turns on and off the driving, is an example of a joint cognitive system. Entertainment robots are examples of mixed teams as are robots for telecommuting. The design process concentrates on how the agents will cooperate and coordinate with each other to accomplish the team goals. Rather than treating robots as peer agents with their own completely independent agenda, joint cognitive systems approaches treat robots as helpers such as service animals or sheep dogs. In joint cognitive system designs, artificial intelligence is used along with human-robot interaction principles to create robots that can be intelligent enough to be good team members."

The processes governing them differ in complexity and speed. There are systems that turn over in minutes, and there are others whose rhythmic time extends to hundreds of years. Some ecosystems are extensive (‘biomes’, such as the African savanna); some cover regions (river basins); many involve clusters of villages (micro-watersheds); others are confined to the level of a single village (the village pond). In each example there is an element of indivisibility. Divide an ecosystem into parts by creating barriers, and the sum of the productivity of the parts will typically be found to be lower than the productivity of the whole, other things being equal.

Often, this fear stems from a lack of control. The pilot is in control, not the passengers, and this lack of control instills fear. Many potential passengers are so afraid they choose to drive great distances to get to a destination instead of flying. But their decision to drive is based solely on emotion, not logic. Logic says that statistically, the odds of dying in a car crash are around 1 in 5,000, while the odds of dying in a plane crash are closer to 1 in 11 million. If you’re going to take a risk, especially one that could possibly involve your well-being, wouldn’t you want the odds in your favor? However, most people choose the option that will cause them the least amount of anxiety. Pay attention to the thoughts you have about taking the risk and make sure you’re basing your decision on facts, not just feelings."

One way to avoid such risk is to contract with a party who is experienced and knows how to do it. For example, to minimize the financial risk associated with the capital cost of tooling and equipment for production of a large, complex system, a manufacturer might subcontract the production of the system’s major components to suppliers familiar with those components. This relieves the manufacturer of the financial risk associated with the tooling and equipment to produce these components. However, transfer of one kind of risk often means inheriting another kind. For example, subcontracting work for the components puts the manufacturer in the position of relying on outsiders, which increases the risks associated with quality control, scheduling, and the performance of the end‐item system. But these risks often can be reduced through careful management of the suppliers."

My scholarly work and my teaching have been deeply influenced by the work of Rosalie Fink. She interviewed twelve adults who were highly successful in their work, including a physicist, a biochemist, and a company CEO. All of them had dyslexia and had had significant problems with reading throughout their school years. While she expected to find that they had avoided reading and discovered ways to bypass it or compensate with other strategies for learning, she found the opposite. “To my surprise, I found that these dyslexics were enthusiastic readers...they rarely avoided reading. On the contrary, they sought out books.” The pattern Fink discovered was that all of her subjects had been passionate in some personal interest. The areas of interest included religion, math, business, science, history, and biography. What mattered was that they read voraciously to find out more."

If, for example, you step on a sharp object such as a pin, nerve endings in the skin will transmit the pain sensation up your leg, up and along the spinal cord to the brain. While the pain itself is unpleasant, it is in fact acting as a protective mechanism for the foot. Within the brain, nerves will connect to the area that controls speech, so that you may well shout ‘ouch’ or something rather less polite. They will also connect to motor nerves that travel back down the spinal cord, and to the muscles in your leg that now contract quickly to lift your foot away from the painful object. Sensory and motor nerves control almost all functions in the body—from the beating of the heart to the movement of the gut, sweating and just about everything else."

Naturally, this movement is so fast that you cannot see it — you just see the blurred outline of the moving string. Strings vibrating in this way on their own make hardly any noise because strings are very thin and don’t push much air about. But if you attach a string to a big hollow box (like a guitar body), then the vibration is amplified and the note is heard loud and clear. The vibration of the string is passed on to the wooden panels of the guitar body, which vibrate back and forth at the same rate as the string. The vibration of the wood creates more powerful waves in the air pressure, which travel away from the guitar. When the waves reach your eardrums they flex in and out the same number of times a second as the original string."

You could also define ability in terms of a particular skill or talent, such as how well one plays the piano, learns a language, or serves a tennis ball. Some people focus on their ability to be attractive, entertaining, up on the latest trends, or to have the newest gadgets. However ability may be defined, a problem occurs when it is the sole determinant of one’s self-worth. The performance becomes the only measure of the person; nothing else is taken into account. An outstanding performance means an outstanding person; an average performance means an average person. Period."

That’s simple, too: one atom at a time. Atoms are the basic building blocks of crystals, and since all rocks are made up of crystals, the more you know about atoms, the better. Crystals come in a variety of shapes that scientists call habits. Common crystal habits include squares, triangles, and six-sided hexagons. Usually crystals form when liquids cool, such as when you create ice cubes. Many times, crystals form in ways that do not allow for perfect shapes. If conditions are too cold, too hot, or there isn’t enough source material, they can form strange, twisted shapes. But when conditions are right, we see beautiful displays. Usually, this involves a slow, steady environment where the individual atoms have plenty of time to join and fit perfectly into what’s known as the crystal lattice. This is the basic structure of atoms that is seen time after time."

Individuals differ in how they like to manage their time to meet work and outside responsibilities. Some people prefer to separate or segment roles so that boundary crossings are minimized. For example, these people might keep separate email accounts for work and family and try to conduct work at the workplace and take care of family matters only during breaks and non-work time. We’ve even noticed more of these “segmenters” carrying two phones ― one for work and one for personal use. Flexible schedules work well for these individuals because they enable greater distinction between time at work and time in other roles. Other individuals prefer integrating work and family roles all day long. This might entail constantly trading text messages with children from the office, or monitoring emails at home and on vacation, rather than returning to work to find hundreds of messages in their inbox."

For example, popcorn is a complementary good to a movie, while a travel pillow is a complementary good for a long plane journey. When the popularity of one product increases, the sales of its complementary good also increase. By producing goods that complement other products that are already (or about to be) popular, you can ensure a steady stream of demand for your product. Some products enjoy perfect complementary status—they have to be consumed together, such as a lamp and a lightbulb. However, do not assume that a product is perfectly complementary, as customers may not be completely locked in to the product. For example, although motorists may seem required to purchase gasoline to run their cars, they can switch to electric cars."

In the 1960s, many people considered pesticides to be mainly beneficial to man kind. Developing new, broadly effective, and persistent pesticides often was considered to be the best way to control pests on crop plants. Since that time, it has become apparent that broadly effective pesticides can have harmful effects on beneficial insects, which can negate their effects in controlling pests, and that persistent pesticides can damage non-target organisms in the ecosystem, such as birds and people. Also, it has become difficult for companies to develop new pesticides, even those that can have major beneficial effects and few negative effects. Very high costs are involved in following all of the procedures needed to gain government approval for new pesticides. Consequently, more consideration is being given to other ways to manage pests, such as incorporating greater resistance to pests into cultivars by breeding and using other biological control methods."

People traveled to worship at the temple. So the old man made arrangements for food and accommodation inside the temple itself. He needed someone who could look after the temple, so he put up a notice: Manager needed. Seeing the notice, many people went to the old man. But he returned all the applicants after interviews, telling them, “I need a qualified person for this work.” The old man would sit on the roof of his house every morning, watching people go through the temple doors. One day, he saw a young man come to the temple. When that young man left the temple, the old man called him and asked, “Will you take care of this temple?” The young man was surprised by the offer and replied, “I have no experience caring for a temple. I’m not even educated.” The old man smiled and said, “I don’t want any educated man. I want a qualified person.” Confused, the young man asked, “But why do you consider me a qualified person?” The old man replied, “I buried a brick on the path to the temple. I watched for many days as people tripped over that brick. No one thought to remove it. But you dug up that brick.” The young man said, “I haven’t done anything great. It’s the duty of every human being to think about others. I only did my duty.” The old man smiled and said, “Only people who know their duty and perform it are qualified people.”"

Emergencies are not always clearly labeled as such; “smoke” pouring into a waiting room may be caused by fire, or it may merely indicate a leak in a steam pipe. Screams in the street may signal an attack or a family quarrel. A man lying in a doorway may be having a coronary ― or he may simply be sleeping off a drunk. A person trying to interpret a situation often looks at those around him to see how he should react. If everyone else is calm and indifferent, he will tend to remain so; if everyone else is reacting strongly, he is likely to become alert. This tendency is not merely blind conformity; ordinarily we derive much valuable information about new situations from how others around us behave. It’s a rare traveler who, in picking a roadside restaurant, chooses to stop at one where no other cars appear in the parking lot. But occasionally the reactions of others provide false information. The studied nonchalance of patients in a dentist’s waiting room is a poor indication of their inner anxiety. It is considered embarrassing to “lose your cool” in public. In a potentially acute situation, then, everyone present will appear more unconcerned than he is in fact. A crowd can thus force inaction on its members by implying, through its passivity, that an event is not an emergency. Any individual in such a crowd fears that he may appear a fool if he behaves as though it were."

Our experiences make us feel alive and give us greater opportunities to grow. Any time you consider purchasing a new possession, stop yourself and think about what kind of experience it will give you. Ask yourself: How much joy will this bring me? Will the joy be temporary or long-lasting? Will the purchase be something I can share with others? If it becomes clear the purchase will provide only short-term benefit to you, think about an experience you could purchase instead that would provide you with longer-term benefits. For instance, if you have your eye on a new pair of shoes for $150, ask yourself what kind of experience you could enjoy for that same amount. Maybe you’d enjoy a concert with friends or a dinner cruise during the summer. Once you think of an experience you’d enjoy, seriously consider diverting the money for the purchase from possession to experience."

In that case, wouldn’t it be more advantageous if there were a certain number of other species around― oaks, maples, or firs ― that would continue to grow and provide the shade needed for a new generation of young beeches to sprout and grow up? Diversity provides security for ancient forests. Because fungi are also very dependent on stable conditions, they support other species underground and protect them from complete collapse to ensure that one species of tree doesn’t manage to dominate."

I didn’t want to be bothered with such a trivial demand. “There’s a garage sale up the street, and there’s something I just gotta have! It only costs a quarter. Please?” I placed a quarter in my son’s hand. Moments later, a little voice said, “Here, Mommy, this is for you.” I glanced down at the hands of my little son and saw a four-inch cream-colored statue of two small children hugging one another. Inscribed at their feet were words that read It starts with ‘L’ ends with ‘E’ and in between are ‘O’ and ‘V.’ As I watched him race back to the garage sale, I smiled with a heart full of happiness. That 25-cent garage sale purchase brought me a lot of joy."

The outsourcing of much of the work of cooking to corporations has relieved women of what has traditionally been their exclusive responsibility for feeding the family, making it easier for them to work outside the home and have careers. It has headed off many of the domestic conflicts that such a large shift in gender roles and family dynamics was bound to spark. It has relieved other pressures in the household, including longer workdays and overscheduled children, and saved us time that we can now invest in other pursuits. It has also allowed us to diversify our diets substantially, making it possible even for people with no cooking skills and little money to enjoy a whole different cuisine.

To make up for the difference in level, engineers build one or more water “steps,” called locks, that carry ships or boats up or down between the two levels. A lock is an artificial water basin. It has a long rectangular shape with concrete walls and a pair of gates at each end. When a vessel is going upstream, the upper gates stay closed as the ship enters the lock at the lower water level. The downstream gates are then closed and more water is pumped into the basin. The rising water lifts the vessel to the level of the upper body of water. Then the upper gates open and the ship passes through. For downstream passage, the process works the opposite way. The ship enters the lock from the upper level, and water is pumped from the lock until the ship is in line with the lower level."

But we all make our own judgement about sell-by dates; those brought up during the Second World War are often scornful of the terrible waste they believe such caution encourages. The manufacturer of the food has a view when making or growing something that by the time the product reaches the shelves it has already been travelling for so many days and possibly many miles. The manufacturer then decides that a product can reasonably be consumed within say 90 days and 90 days minus so many days for travelling gives the sell-by date. But whether it becomes toxic is something each individual can decide. It would seem to make sense not to buy large packs of perishable goods but non-perishable items may become cost-effective."

Some moth species have also evolved scales on their wings and a fur-like coat on their bodies; both act as “acoustic camouflage,” by absorbing sound waves in the frequencies emitted by bats, thereby preventing those sound waves from bouncing back.

In markets where competitors sell slightly differentiated products, advertising enables firms to inform their customers about new products and services.

The most influential situational causes are job resources, feedback and leadership, the latter, of course, being responsible for job resources and feedback. Indeed, leaders influence engagement by giving their employees honest and constructive feedback on their performance, and by providing them with the necessary resources that enable them to perform their job well. It is, however, noteworthy that although engagement drives job performance, job performance also drives engagement. In other words, when employees are able to do their jobs well — to the point that they match or exceed their own expectations and ambitions — they will engage more, be proud of their achievements, and find work more meaningful.

In his 2016 book The Great Derangement, anthropologist and novelist Amitav Ghosh takes on this relationship between imagination and environmental management, arguing that humans have failed to respond to climate change at least in part because fiction fails to believably represent it. Ghosh explains that climate change is largely absent from contemporary fiction because the cyclones, floods, and other catastrophes it brings to mind simply seem too “improbable” to belong in stories about everyday life. But climate change does not only reveal itself as a series of extraordinary events. In fact, as environmentalists and ecocritics from Rachel Carson to Rob Nixon have pointed out, environmental change can be“imperceptible”;it proceeds gradually, only occasionally producing “explosive and spectacular” events. Most climate change impacts cannot be observed day-to-day, but they become visible when we are confronted with their accumulated impacts. Climate change evades our imagination because it poses significant representational challenges. It cannot be observed in “human time,” which is why documentary filmmaker Jeff Orlowski, who tracks climate change effects on glaciers and coral reefs, uses “before and after” photographs taken several months apart in the same place to highlight changes that occurred gradually."

They see no limit to how much information a person ought to consume and never acknowledge the emotional and psychological cost of cramming facts into our brains. If we aren’t using the wealth of available data to make ourselves more productive and useful to society, what’s the point of having it? While access to information is a privilege, it’s also a burden. This is especially true when we treat being well-read as an obligation that can’t be escaped. Constant exposure to upsetting news can be traumatic. An unending flood of information makes it hard to pause and reflect on anything you’ve learned. At some point, even the most voracious of readers needs to pull the plug and stop the constant drip of facts, figures, and meaningless Internet fights. We’re living in an era of information overload ─ and the solution is not to learn more but to step back and consume a smaller amount of data in a more meaningful way."

What began to fascinate anthropologists who studied the San was their detailed imitations of the animals they hunt. The hunters, in some sense, become animals in order to make inferences about how their prey might behave. This spills over into ritual. The San use hyperventilation and rhythmic movement to create states of altered consciousness as part of a shamanistic culture. In the final stage of a trance, Lewis-Williams writes, ‘people sometimes feel themselves to be turning into animals and undergoing other frightening or exalting transformations’. For anthropologist Kim Hill, identifying and observing animals to eat and those to escape might merge into ‘a single process’ that sees animals as having humanlike intentions that ‘can influence and be influenced’."

This approach dominated leadership research from the late 1800s until the mid-1940s and has experienced a resurgence of interest in the last couple of decades. Early trait theorists believed that some individuals are born with the traits that allow them to become great leaders. Thus, early research in this area often presented the widely stated argument that ""leaders are born, not made."" Also, some of the earliest leadership studies were grounded in what was referred to as the ""great man"" theory because researchers at the time focused on identifying traits of highly visible leaders in history who were typically male and associated with the aristocracy or political or military leadership. In more recent history, numerous authors have acknowledged that there are many enduring qualities, whether innate or learned, that contribute to leadership potential. These traits include such things as drive, self-confidence, cognitive ability, conscientiousness, determination, intelligence, and integrity."

Journalism was, by definition, current. The general accessibility of archives has greatly extended the shelf life of journalism, with older stories now regularly cited to provide context for more current ones. With regard to how meaning is made of complex issues encountered in the news, this departure can be understood as a readiness by online news consumers to engage with the underlying issues and contexts of the news that was not apparent in, or even possible for, print consumers. One of the emergent qualities of online news, determined in part by the depth of readily accessible online archives, seems to be the possibility of understanding news stories as the manifest outcomes of larger economic, social and cultural issues rather than short-lived and unconnected media spectacles."

One of the biggest misconceptions about becoming self-confident is that it means living fearlessly. The key to building confidence is quite the opposite. It means we are willing to let fear be present as we do the things that matter to us. When we establish some self-confidence in something, it feels good. We want to stay there and hold on to it. But if we only go where we feel confident, then confidence never expands beyond that. If we only do the things we know we can do well, fear of the new and unknown tends to grow. Building confidence inevitably demands that we make friends with vulnerability because it is the only way to be without confidence for a while. But the only way confidence can grow is when we are willing to be without it. When we can step into fear and sit with the unknown, it is the courage of doing so that builds confidence from the ground up."

Gold plating is especially interesting for project team members, as it is typical of projects with a marked professional component ― in other words, projects that involve specialists with proven experience and extensive professional autonomy. In these environments specialists often see the project as an opportunity to test and enrich their skill sets. There is therefore a strong temptation, in all good faith, to engage in gold plating, namely, to achieve more or higher-quality work that gratifies the professional but does not add value to the client’s requests, and at the same time removes valuable resources from the project.

Multiculturalists suggest that there should be a model of partial assimilation in which immigrants retain some of their customs, beliefs, and language. There is pressure to conform rather than to maintain their cultural identities, however, and these conflicts are greatly determined by the community to which one migrates. These experiences are not new; many Europeans experienced exclusion and poverty during the first two waves of immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. Eventually, these immigrants transformed this country with significant changes that included enlightenment and acceptance of diversity. People of color, however, continue to struggle for acceptance. Once again, the challenge is to recognize that other cultures think and act differently and that they have the right to do so.

To achieve commercial success, that audience must be as large as possible. More than any other characteristics (such as demographic or psychographic profile, purchasing power, level of interest, degree of satisfaction, quality of attention or emotional state), the quantity of an audience aggregated as a mass is the most significant metric for broadcasters seeking to make music radio for profitable ends. As a result, broadcasters attempt to maximise their audience size by playing music that is popular, or ― at the very least ― music that can be relied upon not to cause audiences to switch off their radio or change the station. Audience retention is a key value (if not the key value) for many music programmers and for radio station management. In consequence, a high degree of risk aversion frequently marks out the ‘successful’ radio music programmer. Playlists are restricted, and often very small."

Political risk, unlike credit or market or operational risk, can be unsystematic and therefore more difficult to address in classic statistical terms. What is the probability that terrorists will attack the United States again? Unlike earthquakes or hurricanes, political actors constantly adapt to overcome the barriers created by risk managers. When corporations structure foreign investments to mitigate risks of expropriations, through international guarantees or legal contracts, host governments seek out new forms of obstruction, such as creeping expropriation or regulatory discrimination, that are very hard and legally costly to prove. Observation of a risk changes the risk itself. There are ways to mitigate high-impact, low-probability events. But analysis of these risks can be as much art as science."

From a historical perspective, until the 1700s textile production was a hand process using the fibers available within a particular geographic region, for example, cotton, wool, silk, and flax. Trade among regions increased the availability of these fibers and associated textiles made from the fibers. The First Industrial Revolution and subsequent technological advancements in manufactured fibers added to the fact that fibers and textiles were no longer “place-bound.” Fashion companies created and consumers could acquire textiles and products made from textiles with little or no connection to where, how, or by whom the products were made. This resulted in a disconnect between consumers and the products they use on a daily basis, a loss of understanding and appreciation in the skills and resources necessary to create these products, and an associated disregard for the human and natural resources necessary for the products’ creation. Therefore, renewing a value on place reconnects the company and the consumer with the people, geography, and culture of a particular location."

The suburbs were far more dependent on the automobile, signaling the shift from primary dependence on public transportation to private cars. Soon this led to the construction of better highways and freeways and the decline and even loss of public transportation. With all of these changes came a privatization of leisure. As more people owned their own homes, with more space inside and lovely yards outside, their recreation and leisure time was increasingly centered around the home or, at most, the neighborhood. One major activity of this home-based leisure was watching television. No longer did one have to ride the trolly to the theater to watch a movie; similar entertainment was available for free and more conveniently from television."

You can apply this strategy in your own life anytime you notice signs of stress.

The difficulty is finding what you want. Typically, people want to search using words (rather than, say, example sketches). Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words. The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words. But tags aren’t a comprehensive description of what is happening in an image. It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this. For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street."

It liberated hominin arms for carrying weapons and for taking food to group sites instead of consuming it on the spot. But bipedalism was necessary to trigger hand dexterity and tool use. Hashimoto and co-workers concluded that adaptations underlying tool use evolved independently of those required for human bipedalism because in both humans and monkeys, each finger is represented separately in the primary sensorimotor cortex, just as the fingers are physically separated in the hand. This creates the ability to use each digit independently in the complex manipulations required for tool use. But without bipedalism it would be impossible to use the trunk for leverage in accelerating the hand during toolmaking and tool use. Bipedalism also freed the mouth and teeth to develop a more complex call system as the prerequisite of language. These developments required larger brains whose energy cost eventually reached three times the level for chimpanzees, accounting for up to one-sixth of the total basal metabolic rate."

Despite these limitations, at the beginning of the 21st century, a new “anytime, anywhere” work culture is emerging. Continuing advances in information technology, the expansion of a global workforce, and increased desire to balance work and family are only three of the many factors that will gradually reduce the current barriers to telecommuting as a dominant workforce development.

For most people, the word stereotype arouses negative connotations: it implies a negative bias. But, in fact, stereotypes do not differ in principle from all other generalizations; generalizations about groups of people are not necessarily always negative. Intuitively and quickly, we mentally sort things into groups based on what we perceive the differences between them to be, and that is the basis for stereotyping. Only afterwards do we examine (or not examine) more evidence of how things are differentiated, and the degree and significance of the variations. Our brain performs these tasks efficiently and automatically, usually without our awareness. The real danger of stereotypes is not their inaccuracy, but their lack of flexibility and their tendency to be preserved, even when we have enough time to stop and consider."

Gardeners may recognize yellow leaves as a sign of poor nutrition and the need for fertilizer. But if a plant does not have a caretaker to provide supplemental minerals, it can proliferate or lengthen its roots and develop root hairs to allow foraging in more distant soil patches. Plants can also use their memory to respond to histories of temporal or spatial variation in nutrient or resource availability. Research in this area has shown that plants are constantly aware of their position in the environment, in terms of both space and time. Plants that have experienced variable nutrient availability in the past tend to exhibit risk-taking behaviors, such as spending energy on root lengthening instead of leaf production. In contrast, plants with a history of nutrient abundance are risk averse and save energy. At all developmental stages, plants respond to environmental changes or unevenness so as to be able to use their energy for growth, survival, and reproduction, while limiting damage and nonproductive uses of their valuable energy."

First and foremost, the digitization of sounds ― that is, their conversion into numbers ― enabled music makers to undo what was done. One could, in other words, twist and bend sounds toward something new without sacrificing the original version. This “undo” ability made mistakes considerably less momentous, sparking the creative process and encouraging a generally more experimental mindset. In addition, digitally converted sounds could be manipulated simply by programming digital messages rather than using physical tools, simplifying the editing process significantly. For example, while editing once involved razor blades to physically cut and splice audiotapes, it now involved the cursor and mouse-click of the computer-based sequencer program, which was obviously less time consuming. Because the manipulation of digitally converted sounds meant the reprogramming of binary information, editing operations could be performed with millisecond precision. This microlevel access at once made it easier to conceal any traces of manipulations (such as joining tracks in silent spots) and introduced new possibilities for manipulating sounds in audible and experimental ways."

The multiplication of photographs especially took place with the introduction of the half-tone plate in the 1880s that made possible the mechanical reproduction of photographs in newspapers, periodicals, books and advertisements. Photography became coupled to consumer capitalism and the globe was now offered ‘in limitless quantities, figures, landscapes, events which had not previously been utilised either at all, or only as pictures for one customer’. With capitalism’s arrangement of the world as a ‘department store’, ‘the proliferation and circulation of representations ... achieved a spectacular and virtually inescapable global magnitude’. Gradually photographs became cheap mass-produced objects that made the world visible, aesthetic and desirable. Experiences were ‘democratised’ by translating them into cheap images. Light, small and mass-produced photographs became dynamic vehicles for the spatiotemporal circulation of places."

All that is required is a general sense of a significant difference between working with paints and working with an imaging application. This sense might involve a basic familiarity with paints and paintbrushes as well as a basic familiarity with how we use computers, perhaps including how we use consumer imaging apps. In the case of specialists such as art critics, a deeper familiarity with materials and techniques is often useful in reaching an informed judgement about a work. This is because every kind of artistic material or tool comes with its own challenges and affordances for artistic creation. Critics are often interested in the ways artists exploit different kinds of materials and tools for particular artistic effect. They are also interested in the success of an artist’s attempt ― embodied in the artwork itself ― to push the limits of what can be achieved with certain materials and tools."

Fiction helps portray everyday situations, feelings, and atmosphere that recreate the historical context. Historical fiction adds “flesh to the bare bones that historians are able to uncover and by doing so provides an account that while not necessarily true provides a clearer indication of past events, circumstances and cultures.” Fiction adds color, sound, drama to the past, as much as it invents parts of the past. And Robert Rosenstone argues that invention is not the weakness of films, it is their strength. Fiction can allow users to see parts of the past that have never ― for lack of archives ― been represented. In fact, Gilden Seavey explains that if producers of historical fiction had strongly held the strict academic standards, many historical subjects would remain unexplored for lack of appropriate evidence. Historical fiction should, therefore, not be seen as the opposite of professional history, but rather as a challenging representation of the past from which both public historians and popular audiences may learn."

He soon became quite good at fixing radios. This was in the early 1930s, during the Great Depression, so a boy who could fix radios cheaply was useful. On one occasion, he was picked up by a client who seemed far from convinced that this boy wouldn't be a waste of his time and money. The client kept on asking Feynman how a boy could know anything useful about radios until they arrived at the client's poorhouse. Feeling pressured, Feynman turned the radio on. It started wobbling, then gave out a terrifically loud roar for a few minutes before quieting and playing correctly. He was confused. He had never encountered this before. He shut the radio off, began walking around in the room and thinking. The client was entirely unimpressed. He wanted action, and he wanted to see the boy working. He started protesting to Feynman, asking him to stop wasting his time and get on with fixing the radio, or leave. Despite the heckling, Feynman kept on thinking. He wondered how any radio could make such a noise. Most radios failed because of faulty equipment or loose wiring; he wasn't convinced it would be either. After a while, Feynman came up with a theory: Radio sets in those days were made from a series of tubes. If he took them out and reversed the order, the vibration and noise might disappear. Now, at last, Feynman was ready to act. He changed the tubes and turned the radio on. It worked perfectly. The client was astonished. He became one of Feynman's biggest advocates, telling everyone he knew of the boy who ""fixes radios by thinking."""

It is not enough to simply talk about it. It is critical to have a visual representation of the specific behaviors that leaders and all people managers can use to coach their people.

Scattered attention harms your ability to let go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened focus turns down the stress level because you’re better able to put each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking detail is less important than the bigger picture. It’s like transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still fry an egg, but the egg won’t stick to the pan."

In general, people post because they have something to say ― and because they want to be recognized for having said it. In particular, when people post positive comments they are expressions of appreciation for the experience that led to the post.

For example, owners of forest lands have a market incentive to cut down trees rather than manage the forest for carbon capture, wildlife habitat, flood protection, and other ecosystem services. These services provide the owner with no financial benefits, and thus are unlikely to influence management decisions. But the economic benefits provided by these services, based on their non-market values, may exceed the economic value of the timber. For example, a United Nations initiative has estimated that the economic benefits of ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, including climate regulation, water purification, and erosion prevention, are over three times greater per hectare than the market benefits. Thus cutting down the trees is economically inefficient, and markets are not sending the correct “signal” to favor ecosystem services over extractive uses."

Both are seen as clearly defined and demarcated. People are framed as bounded social actors either playing the role of hosts or guests. Places, in a similar way, are treated as stable containers with clear boundaries. Hence, places can be full of tourists and thus suffer from overtourism. But what does it mean for a place to be full of people? Indeed, there are examples of particular attractions that have limited capacity and where there is actually no room for more visitors. This is not least the case with some man-made constructions such as the Eiffel Tower. However, with places such as cities, regions or even whole countries being promoted as destinations and described as victims of overtourism, things become more complex. What is excessive or out of proportion is highly relative and might be more related to other aspects than physical capacity, such as natural degradation and economic leakages (not to mention politics and local power dynamics)."

Thus, she may prescribe the behavior to them by uttering the norm statement in a prescriptive manner. Alternately, she may communicate that conformity is desired in other ways, such as by gesturing. In addition, she may threaten to sanction them for not behaving as she wishes. This will cause some to conform to her wishes and act as she acts. But some others will not need to have the behavior prescribed to them. They will observe the regularity of behavior and decide on their own that they ought to conform. They may do so for either rational or moral reasons."

This is an extreme view of the nature of scientific contests. Even those who describe scientific contests in such a way note that it is a somewhat inaccurate description, given that replication and verification have social value and are common in science. It is also inaccurate to the extent that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. Yes, some contests are seen as world class, such as identification of the Higgs particle or the development of high temperature superconductors. But many other contests have multiple parts, and the number of such contests may be increasing. By way of example, for many years it was thought that there would be “one” cure for cancer, but it is now realized that cancer takes multiple forms and that multiple approaches are needed to provide a cure. There won’t be one winner ― there will be many."

Similarly most mutations have harmful consequences for the organism in which they occur, meaning that they reduce its reproductive fitness. Occasionally, however, a mutation may occur that increases the fitness of the organism, just as an accidental failure to reproduce the text of the first edition might provide more accurate or updated information. At the next step in the argument, however, the analogy breaks down. A favorable mutation is going to be more heavily represented in the next generation, since the organism in which it occurred will have more offspring and mutations are transmitted to the offspring. By contrast, there is no mechanism by which a book that accidentally corrects the mistakes of the first edition will tend to sell better."

This amounts to saying that the brain adapts to universal science in time but not in space. In fact, even those with great abilities proceed in this way. Thus, when we are astonished by someone with publications in different scientific fields, realize that each topic was explored during a specific period of time.

Conveniently, experiments can separate and realign face and body. When face and body express the same emotion, assessments are more accurate. If face and body express different emotions, the body carries more weight than the face in judging emotions. When they conflict, emotion expressed by the body can override and even reverse emotion expressed by the face. A striking example comes from competitive tennis matches. Players typically react strongly to points they win or lose. When a winning body is paired with a losing face, people see the reaction as positive. And vice versa: when a losing body is paired with a winning face, people interpret the reaction as negative. Impressions go with the body when the face and the body conflict. In these cases, the face alone, without the body, even when viewed close up in a photograph, is not reliably judged for positive or negative affect."

Governments must respond to both, but their dynamics are entirely different and this has profound consequences for the nature of the response. Simply by plotting the aging slope, policy makers go a long way toward understanding the problem: People get older at a constant and reliable rate. There can be disagreements over how to solve the aging problem (this is political complexity), but the nature of the problem is never in dispute. Plotting the number of people killed in natural disasters does very little to advance understanding of this problem other than emphasizing the randomness of natural disasters. Preparing a policy response is, therefore, much easier in some areas than in others. When inputs are reliable and easy to predict, it greatly facilitates information processing and allows for anticipatory problem-solving. When problems are causally complex and multivariate, determining the appropriate response is a reactionary endeavor."

Among the many issues associated with damage-based research are the underlying assumptions this type of work makes and sustains about marginalized people; namely, that marginalized communities lack communication, civility, intellect, desires, assets, innovation, and ethics."

When a hare is being chased, it zigzags in a random pattern in an attempt to shake off the pursuer. This technique will be more reliable if it is genuinely random, as it is better for the hare to have no foreknowledge of where it is going to jump next: if it knew where it was going to jump next, its posture might reveal clues to its pursuer. Over time, dogs would learn to anticipate these cues ― with fatal consequences for the hare. Those hares with more self-awareness would tend to die out, so most modern hares are probably descended from those that had less self-knowledge. In the same way, humans may be descended from ancestors who were better at the concealment of their true motives.

The brain seeks to create meaning through establishing or refining existing neural networks. When we learn a new fact or skill, our neurons communicate to form networks of connected information. Using this knowledge or skill results in structural changes to allow similar future impulses to travel more quickly and efficiently than others.

It has been clear for centuries that tree parents play such an important role in raising their offspring that they can be compared to human parents. A mother tree identifies which neighboring seedlings are hers using her roots. She then, via delicate connections, supports the seedlings with a solution of sugar, a process similar to a human mother nursing her child. Shade provided by parents is another form of care, as it curbs the growth of youngsters living under their crowns. Without the shade and exposed to full sunlight, the young trees would shoot up and expand the width of their trunks so quickly they'd be exhausted after just a century or two. If, however, the young trees stand strong in the shadows for decades ─ or even centuries ─ they can live to a great age. Shade means less sunlight and therefore considerably less sugar. The slow pace of life gently imposed by the mother tree is no accident, as generations of foresters have observed. To this day, they talk of what is known in German as erzieherischer Schatten or ""instructive shade."""

The simplest pathway — direct selling to a customer — is the most useful for a producer for obtaining feedback concerning a product and production method. This pathway is not available to producers supplying today's food chains which typically pass through several intermediates (buyers, processors, wholesalers, retailers) before reaching the customer. Moreover, because there are relatively few processors and retailers, each handling a high volume of goods, the provision of feedback from customers to individual producers on their particular goods is impractical. In today's food chain, customer feedback can, however, be used by the processor or retailer to develop product standards which can then be passed back to the producer as a future production requirement. Thus, information exchange on this pathway can become a one-way flow from customer to retailer/processor to producer rather than the two-way exchange observed via direct selling.

In healthy ecosystems the plants pull more carbon out of the atmosphere than they, and the animals and microorganisms that consume them, need. That extra carbon is stored in living biomass like tree trunks and soil bacteria and fungi, and as carbon compounds in the soil. But when actions like deforestation or plowing severely disturb a plant community, the remaining plants cannot photosynthesize enough to feed themselves, plus all the animals and microorganisms that depend on them.

This pathway is the one that is operating if we hand a homeless person a dollar to make ourselves feel better. Doing so costs us very little — only a dollar — and the reward of doing so — avoiding the guilt we’d feel from simply walking by — is greater. But according to Batson’s hypothesis, there is another pathway, which is other-focused — it’s motivated by a genuine desire to help the other person, even if we incur a cost for doing so. Following this pathway, we act altruistically when we feel empathy for a person and can truly imagine a situation from their perspective.

After all, if the bacterium swam in a straight line simply because the concentration of a desirable chemical was high, it might travel away from chemical nirvana, not toward it, depending on the direction it's pointing. The bacterium solves this problem in an ingenious manner: as it senses its world, one mechanism registers what conditions are like right now, and another records how things were a few moments ago. The bacterium will swim in a straight line as long as the chemicals it senses seem better now than those it sensed a moment ago. If not, it's preferable to change course."

A lot of cargo comes into Duluth: coal, iron ore, grain, clothing and, in November 1962, a mongoose from India. The merchant seamen had enjoyed his company on the long journey and had sat drinking tea with him, but they decided he deserved a life on dry land so they presented him as a gift to the city's Lake Superior Zoo. Lloyd Hackl, the director of the zoo, was delighted and named his new mongoose Mr. Magoo. His fate took an unexpected turn when, labeled an invasive species, federal agents sentenced him to death. The citizens of Duluth were not taking the death sentence lying down. It was pointed out that, as the only mongoose in the country, Mr. Magoo was never going to be able to reproduce, so the country was unlikely to be overrun by the species. They demanded he be allowed to live out his days in peace. Petitions were signed and sent to powerful figures like the U.S. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall, U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey, and Duluth Mayor George Johnson. A campaign, brilliantly nicknamed No Noose for the Mongoose, was backed by more than 10,000 citizens. There were even suggestions that the zoo director should take him into hiding. Thanks to the efforts of the citizens of Duluth, Mr. Magoo was pardoned. A statement from Udall read, ""Acting on the authority that permits importation of prohibited mammals ─ including mongooses ─ for zoological, education, medical and scientific purposes, I recommend that Mr. Magoo be granted non-political asylum in the United States."" He added that it was dependent upon Mr. Magoo maintaining his ""bachelor existence."" The News Tribune joyfully proclaimed, ""MAGOO TO STAY. U.S. Asylum Granted."" President Kennedy declared: ""Let the story of the saving of Magoo stand as a classic example of government by the people."" Living out his days in the zoo, Mr. Magoo became a beloved figure. His daily routine included enjoying an egg, sipping tea, and charming zoo workers with his friendly nature. Popular among visitors, especially children, he received numerous letters and Christmas cards. When Mr. Magoo died peacefully in January 1968, his obituary in the Duluth Herald read: ""OUR MR. MAGOO OF ZOO IS DEAD."" The new zoo director, Basil Norton, vowed not to replace him: ""Another mongoose could never take his place in the hearts and affections of Duluth people,"" he said."

Some of those anthropologists insisted that one should at least spend significant time actually observing and talking to the people studied. Early ethnographers such as Franz Boas and Alfred Cort Haddon typically traveled to the remote locations where the people in question lived and spent a few weeks to a few months there. They sought out a local Western host who was familiar with the people and the area (such as a colonial official, missionary, or businessman) and found accommodations through them. Although they did at times venture into the community without a guide, they generally did not spend significant time with the local people. Thus, their observations were primarily conducted from their verandas."

Moral responsibility is not some universal concept like entropy or temperature ― something that applies equally, and can be measured similarly, everywhere in the cosmos. It is a notion developed specifically for human use, no more or less than languages are. While sentience and volition are aspects of mind and agency, morals are cultural tools developed to influence social behaviour: to cultivate the desirable and discourage the harmful. They are learnt, not given at birth. It's possible, indeed likely, that we are born with a predisposition to cooperate with others ― but only within human society do we come to understand this as moral behaviour."

Many cultures invented gods to explain these eclipses that shocked, frightened, or surprised them; but very few imagined a god of falling bodies ― to which they were so accustomed that they did not even notice them. But the reason for eclipses is ultimately the same as that of the succession of night and day: the movement of celestial bodies, which itself is based on the Newtonian law of attraction and how it explains why things fall when we let them go. For the physicist, understanding the ordinary, the habitual, and the frequent thus allows us to account for the frightening and the singular. As such, it was thus necessary to ask ""Why do things fall?"" and to have Newton's response to understand a broad range of much more bizarre phenomena occurring at every level of the universe."

He founded the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at MIT to form a community composed of artists and scientists. His exhibition in 1951 titled The New Landscape became the basis of his book The New Landscape in Art and Science, which was published several years later. In the book, he presented images that were not previously available, captured by the latest scientific devices. In 1995, a museum to house his works was established in Eger, Hungary.

England became the first industrial nation in the world and, by 1850, the first nation to have more people employed in industry than in agriculture. Expanding trade coincided with the growth of the Empire and brought great wealth to Britain, but this wealth was not evenly distributed. Many enterprising individuals (the 'self-made men') rose from humble origins to positions of wealth and influence, but large sections of the working class were forced into the overcrowded slums of large cities where they worked long hours for low wages in unhealthy conditions. The manufacturing towns of the north of England provided some of the worst examples and inspired such socially conscious novels as Kingsley's Alton Locke, Gaskell's Mary Barton, and Dickens's Hard Times. In the south there was London, already the largest city in the world, showing all the crime, evil, and misery which result from overpopulation and unplanned growth."

We might believe that we generally consider different points of view and make informed decisions. We are, in fact, ""predictably irrational,"" as psychologist Dan Ariely titled his book on the topic. All of us engage in automatic, reflexive thinking, typically taking the easier path and conserving mental effort. Although we each may have the subjective impression that we are careful thinkers, we often make snap judgments or no real judgments at all. In addition, numerous biases inhibit or override reflective, deliberative thought; intuitive theories can also interfere with acceptance of accurate scientific explanations. Understanding more about how our minds work and how biases may operate can make us each less subject to fallacious reasoning, more rational, and more aware of the problems in others' thinking. Learning to understand the built-in limitations of our mental processes can also help us improve our ability to inform others more effectively."

The consensus seems to hold that moths are not so much attracted to lights as they are trapped by them. The light becomes a sensory overload that disorients the insects and sends them into a holding pattern. A hypothesis called the Mach band theory suggests that moths see a dark area around a light source and head for it to escape the light. Another theory suggests that moths perceive the light coming from a source as a diffuse halo with a dark spot in the center. The moths, attempting to escape the light, fly toward that imagined ""portal,"" bringing them closer to the source. As they approach the light, their reference point changes and they circle the light hopelessly trying to reach the portal. Everyone is familiar with moths circling their porch lights. Their flight appears to have no purpose, but they are, it is believed, trying to escape the pull of the light."

Conversely, it can be claimed that a city in which many people are not walking often indicates good city quality. In a city like Rome, it is the large number of people standing or sitting in squares rather than walking that is conspicuous.

Management practices usually involve defining a more desirable future condition and implementing management actions designed to push or guide ecosystems toward that condition. Managers need confidence in the likely outcomes of their interventions. This traditional and inherently logical approach requires a high degree of predictive ability, and predictions must be developed at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, often localized and near-term. Unfortunately, at the scales, accuracy, and precision most useful to protected area management, the future not only promises to be unprecedented, but it also promises to be unpredictable. To illustrate this, consider the uncertainties involved in predicting climatic changes, how ecosystems are likely to respond to climatic changes, and the likely efficacy of actions that might be taken to counter adverse effects of climatic changes.

But those who regard poetry as a different category of language altogether are deaf to the true achievements of the poet. Rather, the poet artfully manipulates the same raw materials of his language as are used in everyday speech; his skill is to find new possibilities in the resources already in the language. In much the same way that people living at the seashore become so accustomed to the sound of waves that they no longer hear it, most of us have become insensitive to the flood tide of words, millions of them every day, that hit our eardrums. One function of poetry is to depict the world with a fresh perception ― to make it strange ― so that we will listen to language once again. But the successful poet never departs so far into the strange world of language that none of his listeners can follow him. He still remains the communicator, the man of speech."

For months, she had been looking for a Philodendron gloriosum, a Colombian plant with dark, velvety leaves shaped like hearts. She had almost given up on getting one. Anna, though, had put one up for sale. The posting read, ""I'm selling my favorite plant, because I'm moving abroad. If you pick it up today from Edincester Heights, you can have it for the current price, which is half the market rate."" Helen immediately messaged the seller. ""Hello! I'm interested in purchasing your plant. If it works for your schedule, I can be there in 10 minutes!"" Anna replied, ""Hi, there! I am at work right now, but my housemate, Julia, can meet you in front of the building."" Unable to believe her good luck, Helen typed back in excitement, ""Great! I can leave now. I'll wear a black baseball cap."" Arriving at the building, Helen could identify Julia by the large paper bag she was holding. The bag had leaves sticking out of the top. She said, ""You must be Julia!"" Laughing, the woman said, ""Yes! Please take good care of this plant. Anna had it for six years, so she considers it family."" From the bag, she pulled out another plant, a tiny one with thick, glossy leaves. ""Are you familiar with this? It's called a Dragon's Tail. My housemate said you could take it too, if you'd like."" Helen exclaimed, ""Yes, I'd love to! Please thank Anna for me. Both are in such wonderful condition. Do you have any tips for keeping them in good shape?"" Handing over the bag, Julia replied, ""I'm not a plant expert, but I know that Anna kept them away from windows to avoid direct sunlight. Why don't you message her? She would be happy to offer advice."" ""I'll be sure to do that,"" Helen said, as she handed over the cash."

They may use comets as stepping-stones, some of which are only loosely bound to our sun because they reach almost halfway to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri. Our remote descendants may eventually colonize much of our galaxy just as the first living organisms on Earth once colonized Earth's young oceans. Interstellar migrations will depend on as yet unimagined technologies for driving ships, for maintaining sustainable environments, and for putting humans into hibernations lasting for centuries. Interstellar journeys will also depend on the existence of groups willing to risk long and dangerous voyages with little or no hope of returning. It would take spaceships traveling at 1 percent of the speed of light more than four hundred years to reach the Alpha Centauri system. But if they spread out from there at a similar rate, they could settle star systems throughout the Milky Way within one hundred million years, which is just a bit longer than the span of time since dinosaurs ruled our Earth."

Intuitively, it seems like it could go either way because there are two competing effects. On the one hand, we ""stand on the shoulders of giants"": previous discoveries can make future progress easier. On the other hand, we ""pick the low-hanging fruit"": we make the easy discoveries first, so those that remain are more difficult. You can only invent the wheel once, and once you have, it's harder to find a similarly important invention. Though both of these effects are important, when we look at the data it's the latter effect that predominates. Overall, past progress makes future progress harder. It's easy to see this qualitatively by looking at the history of innovation. Consider physics. In 1905, his ""miracle year,"" Albert Einstein revolutionized physics, describing the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, the theory of special relativity, and his famous equation, E=mc². He was twenty-six at the time and did all this while working as a patent clerk. Compared to Einstein's day, progress in physics is now much harder to achieve."

The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible. Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving. But that is not possible because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye muscles, which prevents the perfect stabilization of images of the world. These muscle movements are unbelievably small, but their effect is huge. Without them, we would go blind by tuning out what we see shortly after fixating our gaze!

Consider the elegant chemistry at work when living organisms move, think, behave, and act. Certainly, the environment is a factor here because it can influence how we act. An analogy would illustrate this adequately. Think of the environment as gasoline, and our body as the engine. Truly, the engine does not run without the gasoline, but all the intricate parts of the engine are the product of physical architecture, designed and assembled for a reactive purpose long before the gasoline is injected. Inject more gas and the engine accelerates, less, and it slows. The same is true for an organism. Behavior is a response to the environment. We have 'free will,' but the ultimate characteristic of that response can only act with respect to the architecture of our genes and our brain. In other words, the environment can, effectively, accelerate or slow down a potential behavior, but the engine for that behavior is already built and functional; therefore, the environment is but a catalyst."

When wild places are designated as wilderness, they are closed to most commercial activities and residential or infrastructure development. There is thus frequently an economic cost to wilderness preservation. Some critics claim that when wilderness and economic interests clash, economic interests should normally prevail. This argument, even if it is sound, won't exclude all wilderness preservation efforts, because some wilderness areas have little economic value. But a deeper problem with the argument is that it views nature from a human-focused and excessively economic point of view. Allowing economic considerations to outweigh all other forms of value is inconsistent with the biocentric reasons that support wilderness preservation. Thus, while it certainly makes sense to weigh the economic costs of wilderness protection, especially when such costs are high, the biocentric values underlying wilderness preservation exclude viewing economic considerations as the most important."

Adenosine binds with receptors on nerve cells, or neurons, slowing down their activity and making you feel drowsy. But caffeine is also able to bind with these receptors, and by doing so it blocks adenosine's effect, making your neurons fire more and keeping you alert. Caffeine also activates a gland at the base of your brain. This releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands on your kidneys to produce adrenaline, causing your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to rise. If, however, your daily caffeine intake is consistent, your brain will adapt to it. Your brain is like, 'Okay, every morning I'm getting this caffeine that's binding to these receptors and blocking adenosine from binding to them.' So your brain creates extra receptors to give adenosine more of an opportunity to bind with them and have its usual effect. And more adenosine is also produced to counteract the caffeine. That's why it takes more and more caffeine to have the same effect."

Small amounts of water do not indicate the color of these large bodies of water; when pure drinking water is examined in a glass, it appears clear and colorless. Apparently a relatively large volume of water is required to reveal the blue color. Why is this so? When light penetrates water, it experiences both absorption and scattering. Water molecules strongly absorb infrared and, to a lesser degree, red light. At the same time, water molecules are small enough to scatter shorter wavelengths, giving water its blue-green color. The amount of long-wavelength absorption is a function of depth; the deeper the water, the more red light is absorbed. At a depth of 15m, the intensity of red light drops to 25% of its original value and falls to zero beyond a depth of 30m. Any object viewed at this depth is seen in a blue-green light. For this reason, red inhabitants of the sea, such as lobsters and crabs, appear black to divers not carrying a lamp."

If it can overcome these chemicals, it may also overcome the same or similar chemicals used as antifungal drugs. Maybe it also evolves to tolerate warmer temperatures.

Extrapersonal space refers to everything else ― whatever you can't touch unless you move beyond your arm's reach, whether it's three feet or three million miles away. This is the realm of possibility. With those definitions in place, another fact follows, obvious but useful: any interaction in the extrapersonal space must occur in the future.

But even within this strange group, in which food-trapping mechanisms have evolved multiple times independently, some unusual ones stand out. According to Ulrike Bauer, an evolutionary biologist, the visually striking pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis, for example, can exploit external energy for a purpose. This species' pitcher has a rigid, horizontal lid with an exposed underside that produces nectar, luring insects to land on it. When a raindrop strikes the lid's top, the lid jolts downward and throws any unsuspecting visitor into digestive juices below. Researchers used x-ray scans to analyze cross sections of the pitchers when the lid is raised, lowered, and in a neutral position. Their results revealed a structural weak point in the pitcher's neck: when a raindrop hits the lid, the weak spot folds in and forces the lid to quickly move downward, similar to a diving board. The weak point makes the pitcher's body bend and bounce back in a specific, consistent way, so the lid rises back up without bouncing too far ― unlike a typical leaf's chaotic vibration when struck by rain."

History has had many successful rulers and conquerors who have got rid of entire populations, and even beyond that, our species has wiped out plenty of similar humanoid lines that existed on this earth. Scientific finds have so far discovered a number of other humanoid species that once shared the earth with us, some of which include Neanderthals and Denisovans.

But there are no real-life cases of time travel. In situations such as this, philosophers often construct thought experiments ―imagined scenarios that bring out the thoughts and presuppositions underlying people's judgments. Sometimes these scenarios are drawn from books, movies, and television. Other times, philosophers just make up their own scenarios. Either way, the point is to put such concepts to the test. In the case of time travel, for example, a common thought experiment is to imagine what would happen if you went back in time and found yourself in a position to interfere in such a way that you were never born. It seems that something must happen to prevent you from doing this, because if you were to succeed, you would not exist and so you would not have been able to go back in time. As a result of thinking through these sorts of cases, some philosophers claim that the very notion of time travel makes no sense."

You are no longer conscious of all that surrounds you, at least not explicitly. In actual fact, your ears are still 'hearing'; your eyes, though closed, are still capable of 'seeing.' All these signals still flood into the center of your brain while you sleep, but they are blocked by a perceptual barricade set up in a structure called the thalamus. The thalamus decides which sensory signals are allowed through its gate, and which are not. Should they be granted its permission to pass, they are sent to the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By locking its gates shut, the thalamus imposes a sensory blackout in the brain, preventing onward travel of those signals to the cortex. As a result, you are no longer consciously aware of the information broadcasts being transmitted from your outer sense organs. At this moment, your brain has lost waking contact with the outside world. Said another way, you are now asleep."

In ethics, appeals to compassion and empathy can and should be part of rational arguments about ethical decisions. Moreover, the best practices of objectivity often combine partiality and impartiality. In a trial, the partiality of the prosecutor and the defense attorney (and the parties they represent) occurs within a larger impartial context. A judge or jury puts partial arguments to the test of objective evidence and to the impartial rules of law. Ideally, what is fair and objective emerges during a trial where partialities make their case and are judged by objective norms. The norms of objectivity were constructed not because their creators thought most humans could be 'empty' of bias. The reverse is true: the norms were constructed because of an acute awareness of human bias, because it is evident. Rather than conclude that objectivity is impossible because bias is universal, scientists, journalists, and others concluded the opposite: we biased humans need the discipline of objectivity to reduce the ineliminable presence of bias."

Light that manages to miss the retina exits the eye and creates that ghostly glow. When cats' light-gathering ability is combined with the very large population of rods in their eyes, the result is a predator that can see exceptionally well in the dark. Cats 'pay' for this nighttime accuracy with less accurate daytime vision and an inability to focus on close objects. This may seem counterproductive; what is the point of seeing a mouse in the dark if, in that final, close moment, the cat can't focus on it? Tactile information comes into play at this time; cats can move their whiskers forward and use them to get information about objects within the grasp of their jaws. So the next time you see a cat seeming to nap in the bright sunlight, eyes half-closed, remember that it may simply be shielding its retina from a surplus of light."

Of course, there's nothing wrong with chatting and letting the art slide past, but think of the inspiration those museum visitors missed out on. Then apply that to life in general.

She didn't understand why her sister couldn't finish what she needed to do at night and sleep peacefully the next morning. To Maggie, staying up past the time she began to feel sleepy was exhausting. Besides, she loved the fresh morning air. They had fights about simple things like this every day. Tired of the endless arguments, their mother Rachel decided to put an end to them. She would make them understand that each of their points of view could be correct. One day, the twins were brought to the dining table where a big board stood in the middle. Pamela sat on one side of the board and her twin on the other. Rachel asked Pamela what the color of the board was. ""Black,"" she said. After hearing Pamela's answer, Rachel asked the same question to the other daughter. She replied it was white. Predictably, they began arguing. Rachel then asked them to switch seats. Each sitting on a new chair, they were surprised to realize the board was black on one side and white on the other.

Most of us gravitate toward trying to prove our beliefs, to the extent that we bother investigating their validity at all. But scientists gravitate toward falsification; as a community if not as individuals, they seek to disprove their beliefs. Thus, the defining feature of a hypothesis is that it has the potential to be proven wrong (which is why it must be both testable and tested), and the defining feature of a theory is that it hasn't been proven wrong yet. But the important part is that it can be ─ no matter how much evidence appears to confirm it, no matter how many experts endorse it, no matter how much popular support it enjoys. In fact, not only can any given theory be proven wrong; sooner or later, it probably will be. And when it is, the occasion will mark the success of science, not its failure. This was the crucial insight of the Scientific Revolution: that the advancement of knowledge depends on current theories collapsing in the face of new insights and discoveries."

On the first day's sketch test, Professor Wells noticed great potential in a boy named Jack. During the second day's color test, when he walked past the boy, something special caught his attention. Every paint was labeled, and there was a small piece of paper written in the boy's half-hidden paint box: apples are red, pears are bright yellow. This talented student must be color blind! After the art school announced the list of newly-admitted students, Professor Wells found Jack looking longingly through the school gate. It was the same boy who had captured his attention on the test. Wells greeted him. ""I'm Professor Wells, and I teach oil painting here."" ""My name is Jack,"" replied the boy, ""and I was rejected."" Seeing that the boy was heartbroken, he invited him to a small workshop of his own. The room was full of paintings and sculptures. Professor Wells said, ""Once, my dream was to be a basketball player."" Jack was puzzled. ""Why did you stop playing basketball?"" Wells gently rolled up his left trouser leg ― his left leg was an artificial limb. ""Even if we cannot realize our original dream, we will eventually open another door to our dreams."" Wells told Jack to close his eyes and touch a sculpture, and Jack did so. ""An artist's hands are a second pair of eyes. Try to see with them as well."" After that day, Professor Wells never saw Jack again. It was not until six years later that he saw a report in the newspaper about a recent exhibition of modern art. The article said ""This young sculptor was unable to attend art school due to his color blindness. But with inspiration shared by a mentor, he replaced the eyes that could not distinguish colors with his own hands and has become a star in the field of sculpture."" The sculptor was Jack."

Memories are continually distorting in self-serving ways."" A recent study argues that several forms of cognitive bias cause distortions in storing and retrieving memories. This, in turn, has a bearing on theories of agenda setting, priming, and framing, which argue that how people respond to the news is strongly influenced by what is most easily and readily accessible from their memories. But what if memories about news stories are faulty and distort, forget, or invent what was actually reported? In such cases, it may be the manipulation of memories in individual minds that primes, frames, and sets the agenda, not the original news stories."

Unfortunately, you don't have a differential equation-solving device in your brain, so instead you solve a simpler problem: how to place the glove most effectively between the ball and your body. The cerebellum assumes that your hand and the ball should appear in similar relative positions for each catch. So, if the ball is dropping too fast and your hand appears to be going too slowly, it will direct your hand to move more quickly to match the familiar relative position. These simple actions by the cerebellum to map sensory inputs onto muscle movements enable us to catch the ball without solving any differential equations. We are also able to use the cerebellum to anticipate what our actions would be even if we don't actually take them. Your cerebellum might tell you that you could catch the ball but you're likely to crash into another player, so maybe you should not take this action."

For example, competition presents an inevitable conflict between the motivation to achieve one’s personal goal and the desire to maintain good relationships with others. When the maintenance of interpersonal relationships is important, with their counterparts in particular or with others generally, competitors experience an internal conflict that can harm their desire to achieve their goal and taint the good feeling brought about by winning. Exline and Lobel found that the perception of oneself as a target for upward social comparison often makes people uncomfortable. When they believe that others are making envious comparisons with them, people feel uneasiness, distress, or sorrow. Feelings of guilt, an emotion generally associated with high motivation for goal-achievement, lead to weaker motivation and performance in the pursuit of competitive goals. Consequences of this emotional state include lower task motivation in a competition and preferences for more cooperative and altruistic outcomes, such as diminishing the significance of the outcome or sharing the winner’s reward."

Core language teaching materials must concentrate on how a language operates both as a rule-based system and as a sociosemantic system. Very often, the process of learning is essentially analytic, piecemeal, and, at the level of the personality, fairly superficial. Engaging imaginatively with literature enables learners to shift the focus of their attention beyond the more mechanical aspects of the foreign language system. When a novel, play or short story is explored over a period of time, the result is that the reader begins to ‘inhabit’ the text. He or she is drawn into the book. Pinpointing what individual words or phrases may mean becomes less important than pursuing the development of the story. The reader is eager to find out what happens as events unfold; he or she feels close to certain characters and shares their emotional responses.

It teaches critical thinking: the ability to stop and think before acting, to avoid succumbing to emotional pressures. This is not thought control. It is the very reverse: mental liberation. Even the most advanced intellectual will be imperfect at this skill. But even imperfect possession of it frees a person from the burden of being ‘stimulus-driven’, constantly reacting to the immediate environment, the brightest colours or loudest sounds. Being driven by heuristic responses, living by instinct and emotion all the time, is a very easy way to live, in many ways: thought is effortful, especially for the inexperienced. But emotions are also exhausting, and short-term reactions may not, in the long term, be the most beneficial for health and survival.

A score of music imposes rules, but it also creates a pattern of conduct that enables people to produce music. Legal rules that enable the formation of corporations, that enable the use of wills and trusts, that create negotiable instruments, and that establish the practice of contracting all make practices that create new opportunities for individuals.

Although originally invented towards the end of the nineteenth century, it started to become a mass form of transport in the 1920s in the USA and rather later in Britain. Apart from its convenience and flexibility, the car has the additional advantages of affording access to many areas not served by public transport, as well as allowing the easy transport of luggage and equipment. As a result, it was invaluable for the development of many forms of sports tourism but especially those which require the transportation of people and equipment to relatively remote locations."

Over time landowners indirectly monitor farmers by observing the reported output, the general quality of the soil, and any unusual or extreme behavior. Farmer and landowner reputations act as a bond. In any growing season a farmer can reduce effort, overuse soil, or underreport the crop. Similarly, a landowner can undermaintain fences, ditches, and irrigation systems. Accurate assessments of farmer and landowner behavior will be made over time, and those farmers and landowners who attempt to gain at each other’s expense will find that others may refuse to deal with them in the future."

The birds in a line, who could only see their nearest neighbor, not only were less coordinated when scanning, but also were more nervous, changing their body and head positions significantly more than grosbeaks in a circle, where it was possible for each grosbeak to see every other grosbeak.

The focus in related scholarly discourse often revolves around the lifespan or lifecycle of objects and technologies. In this context, maintenance and repair are considered practices that have the potential to prolong the existence of objects, ensuring their sustained utilization over an extended period. Krebs and Weber critically engage with anthropomorphic metaphors that imply a biography of things, appropriately highlighting that conventional understanding of the lifecycle of a technology, from its acquisition to its disposal from the household, provides an incomplete definition. In reality, objects do not conform to a linear lifecycle model; instead, they undergo breakdowns, await repairs, are stored away, or find themselves relegated to the basement, only to be rediscovered and repurposed later. Additionally, objects may enter recycling or second-hand cycles, leading to a dynamic afterlife marked by diverse applications. As such, the life of an object exhibits a far more complicated and adaptive path than a simplistic linear progression."

Typically, synthetic ingredients can be made in a precisely controlled fashion and have well-defined compositions and properties, allowing careful evaluation of their potential toxicity. On the other hand, natural ingredients often vary appreciably in their composition and properties depending on their origin, the time of year they were harvested, the climate they experienced throughout their lifetime, the soil quality, and how they were isolated and stored. These variations can make testing their safety extremely difficult ― one is never sure about the potential toxicity of minor components that may vary from time to time. In some cases, a natural food component has been consumed for hundreds or thousands of years without causing any obvious health problems and can, therefore, be assumed to be safe.

Luckily, in his drawers they found his hat, shoes, sunglasses, and hiking sticks.

The ruminations of the elite class of ‘celebrity’ sports journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism. Yet sports journalists do not have a standing in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do.

Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ― their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and by park users. Moments of park creation are particularly telling, however, for they reveal and actualize ideas about nature and its relationship to urban society. Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody. Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. When entering a city park, people often imagine a sharp separation from streets, cars, and buildings. There’s a reason for that: traditionally, park designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park boundaries, building stone walls, and constructing other means of partition. What’s behind this idea is not only landscape architects’ desire to design aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought that envisions cities and nature as antithetical spaces and oppositional forces."

The performance space itself may further reinforce the distinction with a physical separation between the stage and audience seating. Perhaps because this distinction is so common, audiences seem to greatly value opportunities to have special ""access"" to performers that affords understanding about performers' style of music. Some performing musicians have won great approval by regularly incorporating ""audience participation"" into their concerts. Whether by leading a sing-along activity or teaching a rhythm to be clapped at certain points, including audience members in the music making can boost the level of engagement and enjoyment for all involved. Performers who are uncomfortable leading audience participation can still connect with the audience simply by giving a special glimpse of the performer perspective. It is quite common in classical music to provide audiences with program notes. Typically, this text in a program gives background information about pieces of music being performed and perhaps biographical information about historically significant composers. What may be of more interest to audience members is background information about the very performers who are onstage, including an explanation of why they have chosen the music they are presenting. Such insight can make audience members feel near to the musicians onstage, both metaphorically and emotionally. This connection will likely enhance the expressive and communicative experience."

The statement “Bad science is bad ethics” is true. Putting humans at risk if the study design does not permit a reasonable expectation of valid findings is never ethical. Even a study that presents no risk presents at least an inconvenience to participants and is in that sense disrespectful. The statement “Good science is good ethics,” however, is false. Study design may be scientifically valid, yet the risk of harming human participants is too great to accept. Although achieving the appropriate scientific ends is always the necessary goal of a study, protection of the rights and welfare of human participants must override scientific efficiency."

It was the first serious fight in 40 years of farming side by side. It began with a small misunderstanding and it grew into a major argument, and finally it exploded into an exchange of bitter words followed by weeks of silence. One morning there was a knock on Robert's door. He opened it to find a carpenter with a toolbox. Looking at Robert, the carpenter said, ""I'm looking for a few days' work. Do you have anything to repair?"" ""I have nothing to be repaired, but I have a job for you. Look across the creek at that farm. Last week, my younger brother James took his bulldozer and put that creek in the meadow between us. Well, I will do even worse. I want you to build me an 8-foot tall fence which will block him from seeing my place,"" said Robert. The carpenter seemed to understand the situation. Robert prepared all the materials the carpenter needed. The next day, Robert left to work on another farm, so he couldn't watch the carpenter for some days. When Robert returned and saw the carpenter's work, his jaw dropped. Instead of a fence, the carpenter had built a bridge that stretched from one side of the creek to the other. His brother was walking over, waving his hand in the air. Robert laughed and said to the carpenter, ""You really can fix anything."" The two brothers stood awkwardly for a moment, but soon met on the bridge and shook hands. They saw the carpenter leaving with his toolbox. ""No, wait! Stay a few more days."" Robert told him. ""Thank you for your invitation. But I need to go build more bridges. Don't forget. The fence leads to isolation and the bridge to openness,"" said carpenter. The two brothers nodded at the carpenter's words."

The technical and economic importance of the light and of the electrical system that surrounded it matches that of any other invention we could name, at least from the last two hundred years. The introduction and spread of electric light and power was one of the key steps in the transformation of the world from an industrial age, characterized by iron and coal and steam, to a post‐industrial one, in which electricity was joined by petroleum, light metals and alloys, and internal combustion engines to give the twentieth century its distinctive form and character. Our own time still largely carries the stamp of this age, however dazzled we may be by the electronic, computerized, and media wonders of the twenty‐first century."

Much of it was probably improvised anyway, within certain rules and conventions. So we are forced largely to guess at its basis from the accounts of writers such as Plato and Aristotle, who were generally more concerned with writing about music as a philosophical and ethical exercise than with providing a technical primer on its practice. It seems Greek music was predominantly a vocal form, consisting of sung verse accompanied by instruments such as the lyre or the plucked kithara (the root of ‘guitar’). In fact, Plato considered music in which the lyre and flute played alone and not as the accompaniment of dance or song to be ‘exceedingly coarse and tasteless’. The melodies seem to have had a very limited pitch range, since the instruments generally span only an octave, from one E (as we’d now define it) to the next."

It is one of the most important ideas in Buddhism. Buddhism recommends a daily ritual meditation (known as mettā bhāvanā) to foster this attitude. The meditation begins with a call to think carefully every morning of an individual with whom one tends to get irritated or to whom one feels aggressive or cold and—in place of one’s normal hostile impulses—to rehearse kindly messages like ‘I hope you will find peace’ or ‘I wish you to be free from suffering’. This practice can be extended outwards ultimately to include pretty much everyone on Earth. The background assumption is that, with the right stimulus, our feelings towards people are not fixed and unalterable, but open to deliberate change and improvement. Compassion is a learnable skill, and we need to direct it as much towards those we are tempted to dismiss and detest as to those we love."

Herodotus writes about an exploratory voyage commissioned by the ancient Egyptian King Necho II in about 600 BC. Necho II reportedly ordered a Phoenician expedition to sail clockwise around Africa, starting at the Red Sea and returning to the mouth of the Nile. They were gone for three years. Herodotus writes that the Phoenicians, upon returning from their heroic expedition, reported that after sailing south and then turning west, they found the sun was on their right, the opposite direction to where they were used to seeing it or expecting it to be. Contemporary astronomical science was simply not strong enough to fabricate such an accurate, fundamental and yet prosaic detail of where the sun would be after sailing past the equator and into the southern hemisphere.

Allport considers it normal to be pulled forward by a vision of the future that awakened within persons their drive to alter the course of their lives. He suggests that people possess a need to invent motives and purposes that would consume their inner energies. Similarly, Erich Fromm proposed a need on the part of humans to rise above the roles of passive creatures in an accidental if not random world. To him, humans are driven to transcend the state of merely having been created; instead, humans seek to become the creators, the active shapers of their own destiny. Rising above the passive and accidental nature of existence, humans generate their own purposes and thereby provide themselves with a true basis of freedom."

These unwritten rules typically include getting married and having children, owning your own home and having a mortgage, having a regular job and commuting to work, and flying abroad for holidays. For some people these are realities, for others they remain aspirations. It is common to feel social pressure to comply with them. At this point in Western history, they are amongst the dominant conventions that most of us have accepted with little questioning, much as Vermeer and other Dutch baroque painters of the seventeenth century accepted linear perspective without question.

This will allow an inexperienced teacher to focus on the development of fundamental musical behaviour through listening, performing and composing; and allow the children to focus on the more controllable sound sources i.e. voices and body percussion (clapping, clicking, stamping etc). Music starts with these both developmentally and historically: the most expressive and immediate musical instrument is the human voice. Body movements are not only an instinctive response to music but also instigate music making. Activities which develop many of the coordination skills, aural sensitivity, responses to visual cues and symbols, and the musical understanding necessary to play an instrument can all be established without instruments."

Let one in, and you have to let the other one go. So when you shift a blamer into empathy, you stop the person’s angry ranting dead in its tracks. And what about the person who’s on the defensive? Initially, this human punching bag is frustrated because no matter what he or she is trying to mirror outward the ignorant blamer is blind to it. As a result, the person who’s under attack is usually in a state of quiet, barely controlled rage. Suddenly and unexpectedly, however, the blamer knows just how sad, angry, scared, or lonely the defender feels and spontaneously turns into an ally. When the defender feels understood by the blamer and that they are on the same side, there’s nothing to defend against. The defender’s wall, and with it his unspoken rage and frustration, disappears. The relief from no longer feeling “fear or hatred” toward the blamer spontaneously triggers a tremendous rush of gratitude and—miraculously—the person’s quiet rage turns into forgiveness and, beyond that, a willingness to work toward solutions."

The answer to these questions lies in the fact that pathogen density is much higher in the tropics than it is in temperate and cold climates. When you live in Sweden, chances are good that any group within five hundred miles has been exposed to the same few pathogens. In contrast, when you live in the Congo, the group on the other side of the valley may well have been exposed to a pathogen with which you’ve had no prior contact. For this reason, humans in the tropics learned that when they interacted with other groups they tended to get sick, so they would have stopped doing it. In a pre‐scientific world, it was logical to blame their neighbors for their illness, and therefore to dislike them. Dislike and fear kept neighbors apart, and once you don’t interact with others anymore, your languages and religions naturally divide as well."

Most of the various forms of signaling that are used by different species of animals have not arisen afresh in each separate species. As one species evolves into another, particular forms of signaling may be passed on, owing to the effects of both genes and learning or experience. Some signals have significance across many species, and so remain much the same over generations and in a number of species. But many signals, as they are passed from generation to generation by whatever means, go through changes that make them either more elaborate or simply different. If we examine closely related species, we can often see slight variations in a particular display and we can piece together an explanation for the spread of the display across species. Some very elaborate displays may have begun as simpler versions of the same behavioral pattern that became more elaborate as they developed and were passed on from generation to generation."

Rather, it’s “qualitative changes in the ways students view themselves in relation to the task, engage in the process of learning, and then respond to the learning activities and situation.” In turn, these attitudes and responses on the part of students emerge from the way teachers think about learning and, as a result, the ways they’ve organized their classrooms. If the goal is to figure out how best to cover a set curriculum — to fill students with facts — then it might seem appropriate to try to maximize time on task, such as by assigning homework. But that’s unlikely to have a positive effect on the critical variables that Ames identifies. Perhaps it makes sense to see education as being less about how much the teacher covers and more about what the students can be helped to discover.

On the other hand, Amit saw his bright future in his black buffalo. The buffalo didn’t die. It lived on and helped Amit earn enough money to buy another buffalo. Amit earned more and more and became a successful businessman, whereas Kaanan remained a daily wage earner. He regretted his pessimistic approach towards life."

There is no single, universal or authoritative version that makes sense, other than as a theoretical construct. We can see the world only as it appears to us, not “as it truly is,” because there is no “as it truly is” without a perspective to give it form.

However, those data do not actually show that different cultures have different emotions, if we think of emotions as central, neurally implemented states. As for, say, color vision, they just say that, despite the same internal processing architecture, how we interpret, categorize, and name emotions varies according to culture and that we learn in a particular culture the social context in which it is appropriate to express emotions. However, the emotional states themselves are likely to be quite invariant across cultures. In a sense, we can think of a basic, culturally universal emotion set that is shaped by evolution and implemented in the brain, but the links between such emotional states and stimuli, behavior, and other cognitive states are plastic and can be modified by learning in a specific cultural context."

His birthplace, Axminster in Britain, was rich with fossils, and as a child, he naturally became interested in fossils while collecting them. In 1801, Buckland won a scholarship and was admitted to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He developed his scientific knowledge there while attending John Kidd’s lectures on mineralogy and chemistry. After Kidd resigned his position, Buckland was appointed his successor at the college. Buckland used representative samples and large-scale geological maps in his lectures, which made his lectures more lively. In 1824, he announced the discovery of the bones of a giant creature, and he named it Megalosaurus, or ‘great lizard’.

Rising incomes inevitably lead to increases in motorization. Even without the imperative of climate change, the physical constraints of densely inhabited cities and the corresponding demands of accessibility, mobility, safety, air pollution, and urban livability all limit the option of expanding road networks purely to accommodate this rising demand. As a result, as cities develop and their residents become more prosperous, persuading people to choose not to use cars becomes an increasingly key focus of city managers and planners. Improving the quality of alternative options, such as walking, cycling, and public transport, is a central element of this strategy. However, the most direct approach to managing automobile demand is making motorized travel more expensive or restricting it with administrative rules. The contribution of motorized travel to climate change reinforces this imperative."

A fugue by Johann Sebastian Bach illustrates how far this process could go, when a single melodic line, sometimes just a handful of notes, was all that the composer needed to create a brilliant work containing lots of intricate development within a coherent structure. Ludwig van Beethoven’s famous Fifth Symphony provides an exceptional example of how much mileage a classical composer can get out of a few notes and a simple rhythmic tapping. The opening da-da-da-DUM that everyone has heard somewhere or another appears in an incredible variety of ways throughout not only the opening movement, but the remaining three movements, like a kind of motto or a connective thread. Just as we don’t always see the intricate brushwork that goes into the creation of a painting, we may not always notice how Beethoven keeps finding fresh uses for his motto or how he develops his material into a large, cohesive statement. But a lot of the enjoyment we get from that mighty symphony stems from the inventiveness behind it, the impressive development of musical ideas."

The story the fossils tell is one of change. Creatures existed in the past that are no longer with us. Sequential changes are found in many fossils showing the change of certain features over time from a common ancestor, as in the case of the horse. Apart from demonstrating that evolution did occur, the fossil record also provides tests of the predictions made from evolutionary theory. For example, the theory predicts that single-celled organisms evolved before multicelled organisms. The fossil record supports this prediction ― multicelled organisms are found in layers of earth millions of years after the first appearance of single-celled organisms. Note that the possibility always remains that the opposite could be found. If multicelled organisms were indeed found to have evolved before single-celled organisms, then the theory of evolution would be rejected. A good scientific theory always allows for the possibility of rejection. The fact that we have not found such a case in countless examinations of the fossil record strengthens the case for evolutionary theory."

The idea is that when you are invested and have ownership in something, you overvalue that thing. This leads people to continue on paths or pursuits that should clearly be abandoned. For example, people often remain in terrible relationships simply because they’ve invested a great deal of themselves into them. Or someone may continue pouring money into a business that is clearly a bad idea in the market. Sometimes, the smartest thing a person can do is quit. Although this is true, it has also become a tired and played-out argument. Sunk cost doesn’t always have to be a bad thing. Actually, you can leverage this human tendency to your benefit.

The vast majority of manufacturers still think that product development and service development are always done by manufacturers, and that their job is always to find a need and fill it rather than to sometimes find and commercialize an innovation that lead users have already developed. Accordingly, manufacturers have set up market-research departments to explore the needs of users in the target market, product-development groups to think up suitable products to address those needs, and so forth. The needs and prototype solutions of lead users ― if encountered at all ― are typically rejected as outliers of no interest. Indeed, when lead users’ innovations do enter a firm’s product line ― and they have been shown to be the actual source of many major innovations for many firms ― they typically arrive with a lag and by an unusual and unsystematic route."

Which cue(s) do individuals use as evidence of predator attack? In some cases, when an individual detects a predator, its best response is to seek shelter. Departure from the group may signal danger to nonvigilant animals and cause what appears to be a coordinated flushing of prey from the area. Studies on dark-eyed juncos (a type of bird) support the view that nonvigilant animals attend to departures of individual group mates but that the departure of multiple individuals causes a greater escape response in the nonvigilant individuals. This makes sense from the perspective of information reliability. If one group member departs, it might have done so for a number of reasons that have little to do with predation threat. If nonvigilant animals escaped each time a single member left the group, they would frequently respond when there was no predator (a false alarm). On the other hand, when several individuals depart the group at the same time, a true threat is much more likely to be present."

Technical mobilities turn human beings into some kind of terminal creatures, who spend most of their time at rest and who need to participate in sports in order to balance their daily disproportion of motion and rest. Have we come closer to Aristotle’s image of God as the immobile mover, when elites exercise their power to move money, things and people, while they themselves do not need to move at all?

Questions of morality are often pushed to the side in legislative debate, labeled too controversial, too difficult to answer, or, worst of all, irrelevant to the project. But, in fact, the moral questions of taxation are at the very heart of the creation of tax laws. Rather than irrelevant, moral questions are fundamental to the imposition of tax. Tax is the application of a society’s theories of distributive justice. Economics can go a long way towards helping a legislature determine whether or not a particular tax law will help achieve a particular goal, but economics cannot, in a vacuum, identify the goal. Creating tax policy requires identifying a moral goal, which is a task that must involve ethics and moral analysis."

They may observe their own or neighbors’ farms, but it is the empirical results they are using as a guide, not the neighbors themselves. They are looking at farming activities as experiments and assessing such factors as relative advantage, compatibility with existing resources, difficulty of use, and “trialability” ― how well can it be experimented with. But that criterion of “trialability” turns out to be a real problem; it’s true that farmers are always experimenting, but working farms are very flawed laboratories. Farmers cannot set up the controlled conditions of professional test plots in research facilities. Farmers also often confront complex and difficult-to-observe phenomena that would be hard to manage even if they could run controlled experiments. Moreover farmers can rarely acquire payoff information on more than a few of the production methods they might use, which makes the criterion of “relative advantage” hard to measure."

Concert performances become interesting and gain in attraction from the fact that they go far beyond the information printed in the score. In his early studies on musical performance, Carl Seashore discovered that musicians only rarely play two equal notes in exactly the same way. Within the same metric structure, there is a wide potential of variations in tempo, volume, tonal quality and intonation. Such variation is based on the composition but diverges from it individually. We generally call this ‘expressivity’. This explains why we do not lose interest when we hear different artists perform the same piece of music. It also explains why it is worthwhile for following generations to repeat the same repertoire. New, inspiring interpretations help us to expand our understanding, which serves to enrich and animate the music scene."

It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities.

An ethical issue is an identifiable problem, situation, or opportunity that requires a person to choose from among several actions that may be evaluated as right or wrong, ethical or unethical. Learning how to choose from alternatives and make a decision requires not only good personal values, but also knowledge competence in the business area of concern. Employees also need to know when to rely on their organizations’ policies and codes of ethics or have discussions with co-workers or managers on appropriate conduct. Ethical decision making is not always easy because there are always gray areas that create dilemmas, no matter how decisions are made. For instance, should an employee report on a co-worker engaging in time theft? Should a salesperson leave out facts about a product’s poor safety record in his presentation to a customer? Such questions require the decision maker to evaluate the ethics of his or her choice and decide whether to ask for guidance."

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, with the hugely successful rise of the artistic male couturier, it was the designer who became celebrated, and the client elevated by his inspired attention. In a climate of admiration for male artists and their female creations, the dress-designer first flourished as the same sort of creator.

Writers, by contrast, dive into the unruly, untamed depths of human experiences. What he said about understanding memory can be extended to our questions about young children’s minds. If we psychologists are too bent on identifying the orderly pattern, the regularities of children’s minds, we may miss an essential and pervasive characteristic of our topic: the child’s more unruly and imaginative ways of talking and thinking. It is not only the developed writer or literary scholar who seems drawn toward a somewhat wild and idiosyncratic way of thinking; young children are as well.

A person can be an individual fan, feeling an “idealized connection with a star, strong feelings of memory and nostalgia,” and engaging in activities like “collecting to develop a sense of self.” But, more often, individual experiences are embedded in social contexts where other people with shared attachments socialize around the object of their affections. Much of the pleasure of fandom comes from being connected to other fans. In their diaries, Bostonians of the 1800s described being part of the crowds at concerts as part of the pleasure of attendance. A compelling argument can be made that what fans love is less the object of their fandom than the attachments to (and differentiations from) one another that those affections afford."

Why do plants have this preferential ability to recover from disaster? It is largely because, unlike animals, they can generate new organs and tissues throughout their life cycle. This ability is due to the activity of plant meristems ― regions of undifferentiated tissue in roots and shoots that can, in response to specific cues, differentiate into new tissues and organs. If meristems are not damaged during disasters, plants can recover and ultimately transform the destroyed or barren environment. You can see this phenomenon on a smaller scale when a tree struck by lightning forms new branches that grow from the old scar. In addition to regeneration or resprouting of plants, disturbed areas can also recover through reseeding."

However, social psychologists use this term more precisely. In particular, they define a group as two or more people who interact with, and exert mutual influences on, each other. It is this sense of mutual interaction or inter-dependence for a common purpose which distinguishes the members of a group from a mere aggregation of individuals. For example, as Kenneth Hodge observed, a collection of people who happen to go for a swim after work on the same day each week does not, strictly speaking, constitute a group because these swimmers do not interact with each other in a structured manner. By contrast, a squad of young competitive swimmers who train every morning before going to school is a group because they not only share a common objective (training for competition) but also interact with each other in formal ways (e.g., by warming up together beforehand). It is this sense of people coming together to achieve a common objective that defines a “team”."

In such situations, we use cultural ideas as we would use a particular tool. We select the cultural notion as we would select a screwdriver: certain jobs call for a Phillips head while others require an Allen wrench. Whichever idea we insert into the conversation to justify our actions, the point is that our motives are discursively available to us. They are not hidden. In some cases, however, we are far less aware of why we believe a certain claim to be true, or how we are to explain why certain social realities exist.

Most designers are educated to work as individuals, and design literature contains countless references to ‘the designer’. Personal flair is without doubt an absolute necessity in some product categories, particularly relatively small objects, with a low degree of technological complexity, such as furniture, lighting, small appliances, and housewares. In larger-scale projects, however, even where a strong personality exercises powerful influence, the fact that substantial numbers of designers are employed in implementing a concept can easily be overlooked. The emphasis on individuality is therefore problematic ― rather than actually designing, many successful designer ‘personalities’ function more as creative managers. A distinction needs to be made between designers working truly alone and those working in a group. In the latter case, management organization and processes can be equally as relevant as designers’ creativity."

Then, she sighed, “Sunflowers isn’t here! It’s been lent to a different gallery for a special exhibition. I can’t believe I didn’t check!” “Don’t lose hope yet! Which gallery is the special exhibition at?” Layla asked. Emilia responded, “Well, his Sunflowers is still in England, but it’s at a gallery in Liverpool. That’s a long way, isn’t it?” After a quick search on her phone, Layla stated, “No! It’s only two hours to Liverpool by train. The next train leaves in an hour.

Diaries were central media through which enlightened and free subjects could be constructed. They provided a space where one could write daily about her whereabouts, feelings, and thoughts. Over time and with rereading, disparate entries, events, and happenstances could be rendered into insights and narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It is in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and explored with words” emerges.

After World War II, he studied law at the University of Freiburg until 1949. Early in his career, he worked for the State of Lower Saxony, where he was in charge of educational reform. In 1960—1961, Luhmann had the chance to study sociology at Harvard University, where he was influenced by Talcott Parsons, one of the most famous social system theorists. Later, Luhmann developed his own social system theory. In 1968, he became a professor of sociology at the University of Bielefeld. He researched a variety of subjects, including mass media and law. Although his books are known to be difficult to translate, they have in fact been widely translated into other languages."

The hype promises that we will leave our boring lives, put on goggles and body suits, and enter some metallic, three-dimensional, multimedia otherworld. When the Industrial Revolution arrived with its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world to go to some remote motorspace! On the contrary, we brought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, drill presses, and pencil sharpeners. This absorption has been so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that declare their usage, not their “motorness.” These innovations led to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they entered and affected profoundly our everyday lives. People have not changed fundamentally in thousands of years. Technology changes constantly. It’s the one that must adapt to us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology and its devices under human-centric computing. The longer we continue to believe that computers will take us to a magical new world, the longer we will delay their natural fusion with our lives, the hallmark of every major movement that aspires to be called a socioeconomic revolution."

Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury and certain consumer cases are billed. In this approach, lawyers do not receive fees or payment until the case is settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that the client receives. Therefore, only an outcome in the client’s favor is compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are unfamiliar with and possibly intimidated by law firms. Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take years to settle. By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they pay no fees until they receive a settlement. In these and other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value of the service is hard to determine before the service, and providers develop a price that allows them to share the risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer."

To understand how trends can ultimately give individuals power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a basis for change. The most common explanation offered by my informants as to why fashion is so appealing is that it constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of how people present themselves to the world, and fashion locates them in the present, relative to what is happening in society and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the meanings associated with specific pieces of clothing. Fashion is among the simplest and cheapest methods of self-expression: clothes can be inexpensively purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature, relaxation or environmental consciousness, even if none of these is true. Fashion can also strengthen agency in various ways, opening up space for action."

Nothing is generally wrong with structuring our consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often works well enough. In the case of climate change, however, the sharp division of time into past, present, and future has been desperately misleading and has, most importantly, hidden from view the extent of the responsibility of those of us alive now. The narrowing of our consciousness of time smooths the way to divorcing ourselves from responsibility for developments in the past and the future with which our lives are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that we face the facts but then deny our responsibility. It is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of time, and so questions of responsibility toward the past and future do not arise naturally."

If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water that includes the chemical signatures of creatures that prey on water fleas, it develops a helmet and spines to defend itself against predators. If the water around it doesn’t include the chemical signatures of predators, the water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices. That’s a clever trick, because producing spines and a helmet is costly, in terms of energy, and conserving energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to. So it may well be that this plasticity is an adaptation: a trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed to reproductive fitness. There are many cases, across many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment."

Studying interactions on the dancefloor provides us with a number of illustrative examples of how individuals changing their own behavior in response to local information allow the colony to regulate its workforce. For example, upon returning to their hive honeybees that have collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then the bee is more likely to give up collecting water. Since receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or down) regulates water collection in response to the colony’s need."

Learning to control your voice and use it for different purposes is, therefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early career teacher. The more confidently you give instructions, the higher the chance of a positive class response. There are times when being able to project your voice loudly will be very useful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut through a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great skill to have. However, I would always advise that you use your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting as much as possible.

Issues that can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy to slice. For example, compensation demands can be divided into cents-per-hour increments or lease rates can be quoted as dollars per square foot. When working to fractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the time horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it will last) as a way to fractionate the issue. It may be easier to reach an agreement when settlement terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future. Another approach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may be applied. For example, a company may devise a family emergency leave plan that allows employees the opportunity to be away from the company for a period of no longer than three hours, and no more than once a month, for illness in the employee’s immediate family."

Craftsmanship names an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the computer programmer, the doctor, and the artist; parenting improves when it is practiced as a skilled craft, as does citizenship. In all these domains, craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship can reward an individual with a sense of pride in work, this reward is not simple. The craftsman often faces conflicting objective standards of excellence; the desire to do something well for its own sake can be weakened by competitive pressure, by frustration, or by obsession."

For example, algorithms have proved more accurate than humans in predicting whether a prisoner released on parole will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In over 100 studies across many different domains, half of all cases show simple formulas make better significant predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very uncertain, simple formulas can win out by focusing on the most important factors and being consistent, while human judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and perhaps irrelevant considerations. A similar idea is supported by further evidence that ‘checklists’ can improve the quality of expert decisions in a range of domains by ensuring that important steps or considerations aren’t missed when people are feeling overloaded. For example, treating patients in intensive care can require hundreds of small actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using checklists to ensure that no crucial steps are missed has proved to be remarkably effective in a range of medical contexts, from preventing live infections to reducing pneumonia."

According to Devereux and Ginsburg, laughing with strangers served to create a social bond that made each person in the pair feel comfortable. This explanation is supported by the fact that in their stranger condition, when one person laughed, the other was likely to laugh as well. Interestingly, the three social conditions (alone, paired with a stranger, or paired with a friend) did not differ in their ratings of funniness of the video or of feelings of happiness or anxiousness.

However successful a paradigm is, it will always encounter certain problems — phenomena which it cannot easily accommodate, or mismatches between the theory’s predictions and the experimental facts. The job of the normal scientist is to try to eliminate these minor puzzles while making as few changes as possible to the paradigm. So normal science is a conservative activity — its practitioners are not trying to make any earth-shattering discoveries, but rather just to develop and extend the existing paradigm. In Kuhn’s words, ‘normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory, and when successful finds none’. Above all, Kuhn stressed that normal scientists are not trying to test the paradigm. On the contrary, they accept the paradigm unquestioningly, and conduct their research within the limits it sets. If a normal scientist gets an experimental result which conflicts with the paradigm, they will usually assume that their experimental technique is faulty, not that the paradigm is wrong."

For in order to explain something, whatever it is, we need to invoke something else. But what explains the second thing? To illustrate, recall that Newton explained a diverse range of phenomena using his law of gravity. But what explains the law of gravity itself? If someone asks why all bodies exert a gravitational attraction on each other, what should we tell them? Newton had no answer to this question. In Newtonian science the law of gravity was a fundamental principle: it explained other things, but could not itself be explained. The moral generalizes. However much the science of the future can explain, the explanations it gives will have to make use of certain fundamental laws and principles. Since nothing can explain itself, it follows that at least some of these laws and prinicples will themselves remain unexplained."

Logos roughly referred to the world of the logical, the empirical, the scientific. Mythos referred to the world of dreams, storytelling and symbols. Like many rationalists today, some philosophers of Greece prized logos and looked down at mythos. Logic and reason, they concluded, make us modern; storytelling and mythmaking are primitive. But lots of scholars then and now-including many anthropologists, sociologists and philosophers today-see a more complicated picture, where mythos and logos are intertwined and interdependent. Science itself, according to this view, relies on stories. The frames and metaphors we use to understand the world shape the scientific discoveries we make; they even shape what we see. When our frames and metaphors change, the world itself is transformed. The Copernican Revolution involved more than just scientific calculation; it involved a new story about the place of Earth in the universe."

Reading or translating a work in class, hour after hour, week after week, can be such a boring experience that many students never want to open a foreign language book again. Extracts provide one type of solution. The advantages are obvious: reading a series of passages from different works produces more variety in the classroom, so that the teacher has a greater chance of avoiding monotony, while still giving learners a taste at least of an author’s special flavour. On the other hand, a student who is only exposed to ‘bite-sized chunks’ will never have the satisfaction of knowing the overall pattern of a book, which is after all the satisfaction most of us seek when we read something in our own language. Moreover, there are some literary features that cannot be adequately illustrated by a short excerpt: the development of plot or character, for instance, with the gradual involvement of the reader that this implies; or the unfolding of a complex theme through the juxtaposition of contrasting views."

This modus operandi is illustrated not only by Newton’s Principia, but also by Copernicus’ On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, Kepler’s The Harmonies of the World, and Galileo’s Dialogues Concerning the Two New Sciences. With the advent of scientific periodicals, such as the Transactions of the Royal Society of London, books gradually yielded ground to the technical journal article as the chief form of scientific communication. Of course, books were not abandoned altogether, as Darwin’s Origin of Species shows. Even so, it eventually became possible for scientists to establish a reputation for their creative contributions without publishing a single book-length treatment of their ideas. For instance, the revolutionary ideas that earned Einstein his Nobel Prize ― concerning the special theory of relativity and the photoelectric effect ― appeared as papers in the Annalen der Physik. His status as one of the greatest scientists of all time does not depend on the publication of a single book."

Some businesses are able to increase their production level quickly in order to meet increased demand. However, sporting clubs have a fixed, or inflexible (inelastic) production capacity. They have what is known as a fixed supply schedule. It is worth noting that this is not the case for sales of clothing, equipment, memberships and memorabilia. But clubs and teams can only play a certain number of times during their season. If fans and members are unable to get into a venue, that revenue is lost forever. Although sport clubs and leagues may have a fixed supply schedule, it is possible to increase the number of consumers who watch. For example, the supply of a sport product can be increased by providing more seats, changing the venue, extending the playing season or even through new television, radio or Internet distribution."

Strangers stand further apart than do acquaintances, acquaintances stand further apart than friends, and friends stand further apart than romantic partners. Sometimes, of course, these rules are violated. Recall the last time you rode 20 stories in an elevator packed with total strangers. The sardine-like experience no doubt made the situation a bit uncomfortable. With your physical space violated, you may have tried to create “psychological” space by avoiding eye contact, focusing instead on the elevator buttons. By reducing closeness in one nonverbal channel (eye contact), one can compensate for unwanted closeness in another channel (proximity). Similarly, if you are talking with someone who is seated several feet away at a large table, you are likely to maintain constant eye contact — something you might feel uncomfortable doing if you were standing next to each other."

He tried everything to control his ticklishness: wearing a thousand different hats, using ultra strong hairsprays, and shaving his head. But nothing worked. One day he met a clown in the street. The clown was very old and could hardly walk, but when he saw John in tears, he went to cheer him up. It didn’t take long to make John laugh, and they started to talk. John told him about his ticklish problem. Then he asked the clown how such an old man could carry on being a clown. “I have no one to replace me,” said the clown, “and I have a very serious job to do.” And then he took John to many hospitals, shelters, and schools. All were full of children who were sick, or orphaned, children with very serious problems. But as soon as they saw the clown, their faces changed completely and lit up with a smile. That day was even more special, because in every show John’s contagious laughter would end up making the kids laugh a lot. The old clown winked at him and said “Now do you see what a serious job it is? That’s why I can’t retire, even at my age.” And he added, “Not everyone could do it. He or she has to have a special gift for laughter.” This said, the wind again set off John’s ticklishness and his laughter. After a while, John decided to replace the old clown. From that day onward, the fact that John was different actually made him happy, thanks to his special gift."

You might wonder why this particular configuration of keys, with its awkward placement of the letters, became the standard. The QWERTY keyboard in the 19th century was developed in the era of manual typewriters with physical keys. The keyboard was designed to keep frequently used keys (like E and O) physically separated in order to prevent them from jamming. By the time the technology for electronic typing evolved, millions of people had already learned to type on millions of QWERTY typewriters. Replacing the QWERTY keyboard with a more efficient design would have been both expensive and difficult to coordinate. Thus, the placement of the letters stays with the obsolete QWERTY on today’s English-language keyboards."

A person’s creativity score should tell us his or her creative potential in any field of endeavor, just like an IQ score is not limited to physics, math, or literature. But by the 1970s, psychologists realized there was no such thing as a general “creativity quotient.” Creative people aren’t creative in a general, universal way; they’re creative in a specific sphere of activity, a particular domain. We don’t expect a creative scientist to also be a gifted painter. A creative violinist may not be a creative conductor, and a creative conductor may not be very good at composing new works. Psychologists now know that creativity is domain specific."

No man doubts. No man indulges his inner skepticism. That is the logic of sports psychology. But only one man can win. That is the logic of sport. Note the difference between a scientist and an athlete. Doubt is a scientist’s stock in trade. Progress is made by focusing on the evidence that refutes a theory and by improving the theory accordingly. Skepticism is the rocket fuel of scientific advance. But doubt, to an athlete, is poison. Progress is made by ignoring the evidence; it is about creating a mindset that is immune to doubt and uncertainty. Just to reiterate: From a rational perspective, this is nothing less than crazy. Why should an athlete convince himself he will win when he knows that there is every possibility he will lose? Because, to win, one must proportion one’s belief, not to the evidence, but to whatever the mind can usefully get away with."

Arriving at his seat, he greeted his travel companions: a middle-aged woman sitting at the window, and a little boy sitting in the aisle seat. After putting his bag in the overhead bin, he took his place between them. After the flight took off, he began a conversation with the little boy. He appeared to be about the same age as his son and was busy with a coloring book. He asked the boy a few usual questions, such as his age, his hobbies, as well as his favorite animal. He found it strange that such a young boy would be traveling alone, so he decided to keep an eye on him to make sure he was okay. About an hour into the flight, the plane suddenly began experiencing turbulence. The pilot told everyone to fasten their seat belts and remain calm, as they had encountered rough weather. As the plane rose and fell several times, people got nervous and sat up in their seats. The man was also nervous and grabbing his seat as tightly as he could. Meanwhile, the little boy was sitting quietly beside him. His coloring book and crayons were put away neatly in the seat pocket in front of him, and his hands were calmly resting on his legs. Incredibly, he didn’t seem worried at all. Then, suddenly, the turbulence ended. The pilot apologized for the bumpy ride and announced that they would be landing soon. As the plane began its descent, the man said to the little boy, “You are just a little boy, but I have never met a braver person in all my life! Tell me, how is it that you remained so calm while all of us adults were so afraid?” Looking him in the eyes, he said, “My father is the pilot, and he’s taking me home.”"

In classical Greek mythology, the god of medicine, Asklepios, had two daughters, Hygiea and Panacea. The former was the goddess of preventive health and wellness, or hygiene, and the latter the goddess of treatment and curing. In modern times, the societal ascendancy of medical professionalism has caused treatment of sick patients to overshadow those preventive healthcare services provided by the less heroic figures of sanitary engineers, biologists, and governmental public health officers. Nevertheless, the quality of health that human populations enjoy is attributable less to surgical dexterity, innovative pharmaceutical products, and bioengineered devices than to the availability of public sanitation, sewage management, and services which control the pollution of the air, drinking water, urban noise, and food for human consumption. The human right to the highest attainable standard of health depends on public healthcare services no less than on the skills and equipment of doctors and hospitals."

He earned a degree in mathematical physics at the University of Stockholm in 1918, but after hearing a lecture by Bjerknes, and apparently bored with Stockholm, he moved to the newly established Geophysical Institute in Bergen. In 1925, Rossby received a scholarship from the Sweden‐America Foundation to go to the United States, where he joined the United States Weather Bureau. Based in part on his practical experience in weather forecasting, Rossby had become a supporter of the “polar front theory,” which explains the cyclonic circulation that develops at the boundary between warm and cold air masses. In 1947, Rossby accepted the chair of the Institute of Meteorology, which had been set up for him at the University of Stockholm, where he remained until his death ten years later."

The truth is that managing our own emotions and actions is what allows us to feel peaceful as parents. Ultimately we can’t control our children or the obstacles they will face ― but we can always control our own actions. Parenting isn’t about what our child does, but about how we respond. In fact, most of what we call parenting doesn’t take place between a parent and child but within the parent. When a storm brews, a parent’s response will either calm it or trigger a full‐scale tsunami. Staying calm enough to respond constructively to all that childish behavior ― and the stormy emotions behind it ― requires that we grow, too. If we can use those times when our buttons get pushed to reflect, not just react, we can notice when we lose equilibrium and steer ourselves back on track. This inner growth is the hardest work there is, but it’s what enables you to become a more peaceful parent, one day at a time."

Although infants can notice the effect of their behavior on the physical environment, it is in early social interactions that infants most readily perceive the consequence of their actions. People have perceptual characteristics that virtually assure that infants will orient toward them. They have visually contrasting and moving faces. They produce sound, provide touch, and have interesting smells. In addition, people engage with infants by exaggerating their facial expressions and inflecting their voices in ways that infants find fascinating. But most importantly, these antics are responsive to infants’ vocalizations, facial expressions, and gestures; people vary the pace and level of their behavior in response to infant actions. Consequentially, early social interactions provide a context where infants can easily notice the effect of their behavior."

Instead, the peasant’s aim is to make sure to produce a yield above the starvation level in every single year, even though the time‐averaged yield may not be highest. That’s why field scattering may make sense. If you have just one big field, no matter how good it is on the average, you will starve when the inevitable occasional year arrives in which your one field has a low yield. But if you have many different fields, varying independently of each other, then in any given year some of your fields will produce well even when your other fields are producing poorly."

One possible reason is that receiving help could be a blow to self‐esteem. A recent study by Christopher Burke and Jessica Goren at Lehigh University examined this possibility. According to the threat to self‐esteem model, help can be perceived as supportive and loving, or it can be seen as threatening if that help is interpreted as implying incompetence. According to Burke and Goren, support is especially likely to be seen as threatening if it is in an area that is self‐relevant or self‐defining — that is, in an area where your own success and achievement are especially important. Receiving help with a self‐relevant task can make you feel bad about yourself, and this can undermine the potential positive effects of the help. For example, if your self‐concept rests, in part, on your great cooking ability, it may be a blow to your ego when a friend helps you prepare a meal for guests because it suggests that you’re not the master chef you thought you were."

His team was able to cut cheating in half: instead of “Please don’t cheat,” they changed the appeal to “Please don’t be a cheater.” When you’re urged not to cheat, you can do it and still see an ethical person in the mirror. But when you’re told not to be a cheater, the act casts a shadow; immorality is tied to your identity, making the behavior much less attractive. Cheating is an isolated action that gets evaluated with the logic of consequence: Can I get away with it? Being a cheater evokes a sense of self, triggering the logic of appropriateness: What kind of person am I, and who do I want to be? In light of this evidence, Bryan suggests that we should embrace nouns more thoughtfully. “Don’t Drink and Drive” could be rephrased as: “Don’t Be a Drunk Driver.” The same thinking can be applied to originality. When a child draws a picture, instead of calling the artwork creative, we can say “You are creative.”"

In that case, the person who depended on the refuted argument learns that he needs to change his view. That is one way to achieve humility—on one side at least. Another possibility is that neither argument is refuted. Both have a degree of reason on their side. Even if neither person involved is convinced by the other’s argument, both can still come to appreciate the opposing view. They also realize that, even if they have some truth, they do not have the whole truth. They can gain humility when they recognize and appreciate the reasons against their own view."

This is different from acclimation — an individual organism’s changes in response to an altered environment. For example, if you spend the summer outside, you may acclimate to the sunlight: your skin will increase its concentration of dark pigments that protect you from the sun. This is a temporary change, and you won’t pass the temporary change on to future generations. However, the capacity to produce skin pigments is inherited. For populations living in intensely sunny environments, individuals with a good ability to produce skin pigments are more likely to thrive, or to survive, than people with a poor ability to produce pigments, and that trait becomes increasingly common in subsequent generations. If you look around, you can find countless examples of adaptation. The distinctive long neck of a giraffe, for example, developed as individuals that happened to have longer necks had an advantage in feeding on the leaves of tall trees."

Products with the highest number of misleading or unverifiable claims were laundry detergents, household cleaners, and paints. Environmental advocates agree there is still a long way to go to ensure shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impact of the products they buy. The most common reason for greenwashing is to attract environmentally conscious consumers. Many consumers do not find out about the false claims until after the purchase. Therefore, greenwashing may increase sales in the short term. However, this strategy can seriously backfire when consumers find out they are being deceived."

This pressure from society combined with FOMO can wear us down. According to a recent survey, 70 percent of employees admit that when they take a vacation, they still don’t disconnect from work. Our digital habits, which include constantly checking emails, and social media timelines, have become so firmly established, it is nearly impossible to simply enjoy the moment, along with the people with whom we are sharing these moments. JOMO (the joy of missing out) is the emotionally intelligent antidote to FOMO and is essentially about being present and being content with where you are at in life. You do not need to compare your life to others but instead, practice tuning out the background noise of the “shoulds” and “wants” and learn to let go of worrying whether you are doing something wrong. JOMO allows us to live life in the slow lane, to appreciate human connections, to be intentional with our time, to practice saying “no,” to give ourselves “tech‐free breaks,” and to give ourselves permission to acknowledge where we are and to feel emotions. Instead of constantly trying to keep up with the rest of society, JOMO allows us to be who we are in the present moment. When you free up that competitive and anxious space in your brain, you have so much more time, energy, and emotion to conquer your true priorities."

But research reveals that a number of vital tasks carried out during sleep help to maintain good health and enable people to function at their best. While you sleep, your brain is hard at work forming the pathways necessary for learning and creating memories and new insights. Without enough sleep, you can’t focus and pay attention or respond quickly. A lack of sleep may even cause mood problems.

It wasn’t easy for Leeuwenhoek to become a scientist. He knew only one language — Dutch — which was quite unusual for scientists of his time. But his curiosity was endless, and he worked hard. He had an important skill. He knew how to make things out of glass. This skill came in handy when he made lenses for his simple microscope. He saw tiny veins with blood flowing through them. He also saw living bacteria in pond water. He paid close attention to the things he saw and wrote down his observations.

But those who are able to distinguish between a range of various emotions “do much, much better at managing the ups and downs of ordinary existence than those who see everything in black and white.” In fact, research shows that the process of labeling emotional experience is related to greater emotion regulation and psychosocial well-being."

Avoiding rejection negatively affects many aspects of your life. All of that happens only because you’re not tough enough to handle it. For this reason, consider rejection therapy. Come up with a request or an activity that usually results in a rejection. Working in sales is one such example. Asking for discounts at the stores will also work.

Such absence of subtitles allows the audience to feel a similar sense of incomprehension and alienation that the character feels. An example of this is seen in Not Without My Daughter.

Manganese can be very harmful to plants, especially at high concentrations. Common blackberry is unaffected by damaging effects of this metal and has evolved two different ways of using manganese to its advantage. First, it redistributes manganese from deeper soil layers to shallow soil layers using its roots as a small pipe. Second, it absorbs manganese as it grows, concentrating the metal in its leaves. When the leaves drop and decay, their concentrated manganese deposits further poison the soil around the plant. For plants that are not immune to the toxic effects of manganese, this is very bad news. Essentially, the common blackberry eliminates competition by poisoning its neighbors with heavy metals."

Like, deep inside, something is missing? That's because we are living someone else's life. We allow other people to influence our choices. We are trying to meet their expectations. Social pressure is deceiving ― we are all impacted without noticing it. Before we realize we are losing ownership of our lives, we end up envying how other people live. Then, we can only see the greener grass ― ours is never good enough. To regain that passion for the life you want, you must recover control of your choices. No one but yourself can choose how you live. But, how? The first step to getting rid of expectations is to treat yourself kindly. You can't truly love other people if you don't love yourself first. When we accept who we are, there's no room for other's expectations."

However, the reality is that they have historically caused more materials use, making us dependent on more natural resources. The world now consumes far more “stuff” than it ever has. We use twenty-seven times more industrial minerals, such as gold, copper, and rare metals, than we did just over a century ago. We also each individually use more resources.

His image immediately attracted the other students’ interest. So, everyone rushed to talk about whose hand it was. “It must be the hand of God that brings us food,” said one student. “A farmer’s,” said a second student, “because they raise the turkeys.” “It looks more like a police officer’s,” added another, “they protect us.” The class was so responsive that Mrs. Klein had almost forgotten about Douglas.

For example, when you try to push a book along the floor, friction makes this difficult. Friction always works in the direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving, or trying to move. So, friction always slows a moving object down. The amount of friction depends on the surface materials. The rougher the surface is, the more friction is produced. Friction also produces heat. For example, if you rub your hands together quickly, they will get warmer. Friction can be a useful force because it prevents our shoes slipping on the floor when we walk and stops car tires skidding on the road. When you walk, friction is caused between the tread on your shoes and the ground, acting to grip the ground and prevent sliding."

Giffen goods are special types of products for which the traditional law of demand does not apply. Instead of switching to cheaper replacements, consumers demand more of giffen goods when the price increases and less of them when the price decreases. Taking an example, rice in China is a giffen good because people tend to purchase less of it when the price falls. The reason for this is, when the price of rice falls, people have more money to spend on other types of products such as meat and dairy and, therefore, change their spending pattern. On the other hand, as rice prices increase, people consume more rice."

The study reports that when facing difficulties, adolescents exposed to an authoritative parenting style are less likely to be passive, helpless, and afraid to fail. Another study of nine high schools in Wisconsin and northern California indicates that children of authoritative parents do well in school, because these parents put a lot of effort into getting involved in their children’s school activities. That is, authoritative parents are significantly more likely to help their children with homework, to attend school programs, to watch their children in sports, and to help students select courses. Moreover, these parents are more aware of what their children do and how they perform in school. Finally, authoritative parents praise academic excellence and the importance of working hard more than other parents do."

However, the tired farmer did not want to give up on the search for his watch and asked a group of children playing outside to help him.

After hearing about the reward, the children hurried inside the barn and went through and round the entire pile of hay looking for the watch. After a long time searching for it, some of the children got tired and gave up. The number of children looking for the watch slowly decreased and only a few tired children were left. The farmer gave up all hope of finding it and called off the search. Just when the farmer was closing the barn door, a little boy came up to him and asked the farmer to give him another chance. The farmer did not want to lose out on any chance of finding the watch so let him in the barn. After a little while the boy came out with the farmer’s watch in his hand. He was happily surprised and asked how he had succeeded to find the watch while everyone else had failed. He replied “I just sat there and tried listening for the sound of the watch. In silence, it was much easier to hear it and follow the direction of the sound.” He was delighted to get his watch back and rewarded the little boy as promised."

In their ears are headpieces: the voice of ‘Jennifer’, a piece of software, tells them where to go and what to do, controlling the smallest details of their movements. Jennifer breaks down instructions into tiny chunks, to minimise error and maximise productivity ― for example, rather than picking eighteen copies of a book off a shelf, the human worker would be politely instructed to pick five. Then another five. Then yet another five. Then another three. Working in such conditions reduces people to machines made of flesh. Rather than asking us to think or adapt, the Jennifer unit takes over the thought process and treats workers as an inexpensive source of some visual processing and a pair of opposable thumbs."

They are native to the deserts of South Africa but commonly sold in garden centers and nurseries. Lithops grow well in compacted, sandy soil with little water and extreme hot temperatures. Lithops are small plants, rarely getting more than an inch above the soil surface and usually with only two leaves. The thick leaves resemble the cleft in an animal’s foot or just a pair of grayish brown stones gathered together. The plants have no true stem and much of the plant is underground. Their appearance has the effect of conserving moisture."

One ear always contained a message that the listener had to repeat back (called “shadowing”) while the other ear included people speaking. The trick was to see if you could totally focus on the main message and also hear someone talking in your other ear. Cleverly, Cherry found it was impossible for his participants to know whether the message in the other ear was spoken by a man or woman, in English or another language, or was even comprised of real words at all! In other words, people could not process two pieces of information at the same time."

The reason people are hungry in those countries is that the products produced there can be sold on the world market for more than the local citizens can afford to pay for them. In the modern age you do not starve because you have no food, you starve because you have no money.

For example, if you stand in bare feet with one foot on carpet and the other on a tile floor, the tile feels colder than the carpet even though both are at the same temperature. The two objects feel different because tile transfers energy by heat at a higher rate than carpet does. Your skin “measures” the rate of energy transfer by heat rather than the actual temperature. What we need is a reliable and reproducible method for measuring the relative hotness or coldness of objects rather than the rate of energy transfer.

It may be very difficult to convince an entire society that insects are totally suitable for consumption. However, there are examples in which this reversal of attitudes about certain foods has happened to an entire society. Several examples in the past 120 years from European-American society are: considering lobster a luxury food instead of a food for servants and prisoners; considering sushi a safe and delicious food; and considering pizza not just a food for the rural poor of Sicily. In Latin American countries, where insects are already consumed, a portion of the population hates their consumption and associates it with poverty. There are also examples of people who have had the habit of consuming them and broken that habit due to shame, and because they do not want to be categorized as poor or uncivilized. According to Esther Katz, an anthropologist, if the consumption of insects as a food luxury is to be promoted, there would be more chances that some individuals who do not present this habit overcome ideas under which they were educated. And this could also help to revalue the consumption of insects by those people who already eat them."

The attempt to straighten rivers and give them regular cross-ections is perhaps the most disastrous example of this form-and-function relationship. The natural river has a very irregular form: it curves a lot, spills across floodplains, and leaks into wetlands, giving it an ever-changing and incredibly complex shoreline. This allows the river to accommodate variations in water level and speed. Pushing the river into tidy geometry destroys functional capacity and results in disasters like the Mississippi floods of 1927 and 1993 and, more recently, the unnatural disaster of Hurricane Katrina.

Television watching does satisfy these social needs to some extent, at least in the short run. Unfortunately, it is also likely to “crowd out” other activities that produce more sustainable social contributions to our social well-being.

Doctors such as Jon Snow, from England, and Rudolf Virchow, of Germany, saw the connection between poor living conditions, overcrowding, sanitation, and disease. A recognition of this connection led to the replanning and rebuilding of cities to stop the spread of epidemics.

Children systematically measure themselves against their peers on everything from skateboarding ability to who has the most friends. They are especially sensitive to any failure that is talked about openly within their own family. Accordingly, parents who want a little peace at home should guard against comparative comments that routinely favor one child over another.

The rate of bar‑pressing was automatically recorded. Initially, the rat might press the bar accidentally, or simply out of curiosity, and as a consequence receive some food. Over time, the rat learned that food appeared whenever the bar was pressed, and began to press it purposefully in order to be fed. Comparing results from rats given the ""positive reinforcement"" of food for their bar‑pressing behavior with those that were not, or were presented with food at different rates, it became clear that when food appeared as a consequence of the rat's actions, this influenced its future behavior."

It's easier for a person to accept new values or ideas when they see that others have already done so. If the person they see accepting the new idea happens to be a friend, then social proof has even more power by exerting peer pressure as well as relying on the trust that people put in the judgments of their close friends. For example, a video about some issue may be controversial on its own but more credible if it got thousands of likes. If a friend recommends the video to you, in many cases, the credibility of the idea it presents will rise in direct proportion to the trust you place in the friend recommending the video. This is the power of social media and part of the reason why videos or ""posts"" can become ""viral."""

This is tricky to enforce, though, because satellites can (and often do) fail. To tackle this problem, several companies around the world have come up with novel solutions. These include removing dead satellites from orbit and dragging them back into the atmosphere, where they will burn up. Ways we could do this include using a harpoon to grab a satellite, catching it in a huge net, using magnets to grab it, or even firing lasers to heat up the satellite, increasing its atmospheric drag so that it falls out of orbit. However, these methods are only useful for large satellites orbiting Earth. There isn’t really a way for us to pick up smaller pieces of debris such as bits of paint and metal. We just have to wait for them to naturally re-enter Earth’s atmosphere."

By the age of fourteen, Dunbar had poems published in the Dayton Herald. While in high school he edited his high school newspaper. Despite being a fine student, Dunbar was financially unable to attend college and took a job as an elevator operator. In 1893, Dunbar published his first book, Oak and Ivy, at his own expense. In 1895, he published the second book, Majors and Minors, which brought him national and international recognition. The poems written in standard English were called “majors,” and those in dialect were termed “minors.” Although the “major” poems in standard English outnumber those written in dialect, it was the dialect poems that brought Dunbar the most attention."

One famous ancient fable of the fox and the cat explains this situation of paralysis by analysis in the simplest way. In the story, the fox and the cat discuss how many ways they have to escape their hunters. Cat quickly climbs a tree. Fox, on the other hand, begins to analyze all the ways to escape that he knows. But unable to decide which one would be the best, he fails to act and gets caught by the dogs. This story perfectly illustrates the analysis paralysis phenomenon: the inability to act or decide due to overthinking about available alternatives. People experience that although they start with a good intention to find a solution to a problem, they often analyze indefinitely about various factors that might lead to wrong decisions. They don't feel satisfied with the available information and think they still need more data to perfect their decision. Most often this situation of paralysis by analysis arises when somebody is afraid of making an erroneous decision that can lead to potential catastrophic consequences: It might impact their careers or their organizations' productivity. So that's why people are generally overcautious in making decisions that involve huge stakes."

But when the same population was asked whether they supported spending more government money on 'welfare', only 21 percent were in favour. In other words, if you ask people about individual welfare programmes—such as giving financial help to people who have long‐term illnesses and paying for school meals for families with low income—people are broadly in favour of them. But if you ask about 'welfare'—which refers to those exact same programmes that you've just listed—they're against it. The word 'welfare' has negative connotations, perhaps because of the way many politicians and newspapers portray it. Therefore, the framing of a question can heavily influence the answer in many ways, which matters if your aim is to obtain a 'true measure' of what people think.

In 1901 he had an idea to speed up the manufacturing process — instead of building one car at a time, he created the assembly line. The acceleration in production was unheard‐of—from an output of 425 automobiles in 1901 to an impressive 2,500 cars the following year. While other competitors were in awe of this incredible volume, Henry Ford dared to ask, ""Can we do even better?"" He was, in fact, able to improve upon Olds's clever idea by introducing conveyor belts to the assembly line. As a result, Ford's production went through the roof. Instead of taking a day and a half to manufacture a Model T, as in the past, he was now able to spit them out at a rate of one car every ninety minutes.

The playground and the media do that for them. However, we do need to teach them that there is more to life than winning and about the skills they need for successful cooperation. A group working together successfully requires individuals with a multitude of social skills, as well as a high level of interpersonal awareness.

Because of this, nurses play a crucial role in interdisciplinary communication. They have a mediating role between the various groups of professionals and the patient and carer. This involves translating communication between groups into language that is acceptable and comprehensible to people who have different ways of understanding mental health problems. This is a highly sensitive and skilled task, requiring a high level of attention to alternative views and a high level of understanding of communication."

No single individual, acting on his or her own, can produce an ethos. Rather, an ethos results from the interdependent acts of many individuals. This cluster of produced meaning may require some degree of insulation from larger and wealthier outside forces. The Canadian Inuit maintain their own ethos, even though they number no more than twenty-four thousand. They manage this feat through a combination of trade, to support their way of life, and geographic isolation. The Inuit occupy remote territory, removed from major population centers of Canada. If cross-cultural contact were to become sufficiently close, the Inuit ethos would disappear. Distinct cultural groups of similar size do not, in the long run, persist in downtown Toronto, Canada, where they come in contact with many outside influences and pursue essentially Western paths for their lives."

That means that little creatures have to produce heat more rapidly than large creatures. They must therefore lead completely different lifestyles. An elephant’s heart beats just thirty times a minute, a human’s sixty, a cow’s between fifty and eighty, but a mouse’s beats six hundred times a minute—ten times a second. Every day, just to survive, the mouse must eat about 50 percent of its own body weight. We humans, by contrast, need to consume only about 2 percent of our body weight to supply our energy requirements. One area where animals are curiously uniform is with the number of heartbeats they have in a lifetime. Despite the vast differences in heart rates, nearly all mammals have about 800 million heartbeats in them if they live an average life. The exception is humans. We pass 800 million heartbeats after twenty-five years, and just keep on going for another fifty years and 1.6 billion heartbeats or so."

Perhaps more than any other texts, they reflect society as it wishes to be, as it wishes to be seen, and as it unconsciously reveals itself to be, at least to writers. Clearly, literature is not the only socialising agent in the life of children, even among the media. It is possible to argue, for example, that, today, the influence of books is vastly overshadowed by that of television. There is, however, a considerable degree of interaction between the two media. Many so-called children’s literary classics are televised, and the resultant new book editions strongly suggest that viewing can encourage subsequent reading. Similarly, some television series for children are published in book form."

Many of us tend to assume that using email requires little more than the electricity used to power our computers. It's easy to overlook the invisible energy usage involved in running the network ― particularly when it comes to sending and storing data. Every single email in every single inbox in the world is stored on a server. The incredible quantity of data requires huge server farms ― gigantic centres with millions of computers which store and transmit information. These servers consume massive amounts of energy, 24 hours a day, and require countless litres of water, or air conditioning systems, for cooling. The more messages we send, receive and store, the more servers are needed ― which means more energy consumed, and more carbon emissions. Clearly, sending and receiving electronic messages in an environmentally conscious manner is by no means enough to stop climate change.

The following day, Melanie accompanied her mother to a local dance institute. Upon meeting the dance teacher, Mr. Edler, her mother requested to admit Melanie to his institute. The teacher asked Melanie to audition. She was happy and showed him some of her favorite dance steps. However, he wasn't interested in her dance. He was busy with other tasks in the dance room. ""You can leave now! The girl is just average. Don't let her waste her time aspiring to be a dancer,"" he said. Melanie and her mother were shocked to hear this. Disappointed, they returned home, tears rolling down Melanie's cheeks. With her confidence and ego hurt, Melanie never danced again. She completed her studies and became a schoolteacher. One day, the ballet instructor at her school was running late, and Melanie was asked to keep an eye on the class so that they wouldn't roam around the school. Once inside the ballet room, she couldn't control herself. She taught the students some steps and kept on dancing for some time. Unaware of time or the people around her, she was lost in her own little world of dancing. Just then, the ballet instructor entered the classroom and was surprised to see Melanie's incredible skill. ""What a performance!"" the instructor said with a sparkle in her eyes. Melanie was embarrassed to see the instructor in front of her. ""Sorry, Ma'am!"" she said. ""For what?"" the instructor asked. ""You are a true ballerina!"" The instructor invited Melanie to accompany her to a ballet training center, and Melanie has never stopped dancing since. Today, she is a world‐renowned ballet dancer."

Changes in the speed of the eyelid can indicate important information; shutter speed is a measurement of fear. Think of an animal that has a reputation for being fearful. A Chihuahua might come to mind. In mammals, because of evolution, our eyelids will speed up to minimize the amount of time that we can't see an approaching predator. The greater the degree of fear an animal is experiencing, the more the animal is concerned with an approaching predator. In an attempt to keep the eyes open as much as possible, the eyelids involuntarily speed up. Speed, when it comes to behavior, almost always equals fear.

A classic example of anchoring bias in emergency medicine is ""triage bias,"" where whatever the first impression you develop, or are given, about a patient tends to influence all subsequent providers seeing that patient. For example, imagine two patients presenting for emergency care with aching jaw pain that occasionally extends down to their chest. Differences in how the intake providers label the chart — ""jaw pain"" vs. ""chest pain,"" for example — create anchors that might result in significant differences in how the patients are treated."

But that's probably the extent of the specifics. Those additional details that are apparently unimportant are actively deleted from your brain the more you go about remembering the situation. The reason for this is that the brain does not consider it valuable to remember all of the details as long as it is able to convey the main message (i.e., your first day of school was great).

A great example of this can be seen along the West Coast of the United States. Air moving from the Pacific Ocean toward the land usually has a great deal of moisture in it. When this humid air moves across the land, it encounters the Coast Range Mountains. As the air moves up and over the mountains, it begins to cool, which causes precipitation on the windward side of the mountains. Once the air moves down the opposite side of the mountains (called the leeward side) it has lost a great deal of moisture. The air continues to move and then hits the even higher Sierra Nevada mountain range. This second uplift causes most of the remaining moisture to fall out of the air, so by the time it reaches the leeward side of the Sierras, the air is extremely dry. The result is that much of the state of Nevada is a desert."

In fact, the exact opposite happened. Before the imposition of fines, parents felt guilty about arriving late, and guilt was effective in ensuring that only a few did so. Once a fine was introduced, it seems that in the minds of the parents the entire scenario was changed from a social contract to a market one. Essentially, they were paying for the center to look after their children after hours. Some parents thought it worth the price, and the rate of late arrivals increased. Significantly, once the center abandoned the fines and went back to the previous arrangement, late arrivals remained at the high level they had reached during the period of the fines."

When they see a situation in front of them, they quickly match it to a sea of past experiences stored in a mental knowledge bank and then, based on a match, they assign meaning to the information in front of them.

By contrast, the British government—except in extreme cases — placed most of the responsibility with the individual consumers.

In the 1840s, a patent was granted for a machine designed for making fake coffee beans out of chicory, using the same technology that went into manufacturing bullets.

A violin has many more overtones compared to a flute and sounds brighter. An oboe is brighter than a classical guitar, and a crash cymbal brighter than a double bass. This is obvious, and indeed people like brightness. One reason is that it makes sound subjectively louder, which is part of the loudness war in modern electronic music, and in the classical music of the 19th century. All sound engineers know that if they play back a track to a musician that just has recorded this track and add some higher frequencies, the musician will immediately like the track much better. But this is a short-lived effect, and in the long run, people find such sounds too bright. So it is wise not to play back such a track with too much brightness, as it normally takes quite some time to convince the musician that less brightness serves his music better in the end."

The graphs were actually of past changes in the stock market, but Mayraz told people that the graphs showed recent changes in the price of wheat. He asked each person to predict where the price would move next ― and offered them a reward if their forecasts came true. But Mayraz had also divided his participants into two categories, ""farmers"" and ""bakers"". Farmers would be paid extra if wheat prices were high. Bakers would earn a bonus if wheat was cheap. So the subjects might earn two separate payments: one for an accurate forecast, and a bonus if the price of wheat moved in their direction. Mayraz found that the prospect of the bonus influenced the forecast itself. The farmers hoped and predicted that the price of wheat would rise. The bakers hoped for ― and predicted ― the opposite. They let their hopes influence their reasoning."

If you are not a fan of stories, you might imagine that the best world is a world without them, where we can only see the facts in front of us. But to do this is to deny how our brains work, how they are designed to work. Evolution has given us minds that are alert to stories and suggestion because, through many hundreds of thousands of years of natural selection, minds that can attend to stories have been more successful at passing on their owners' genes. Think about what happens, for example, when animals face one another in conflict. They rarely plunge into battle right away. No, they first try to signal in all kinds of ways what the outcome of the battle is going to be. They puff up their chests, they roar, and they bare their fangs. Animals evolved to attend to stories and signals because these turn out to be an efficient way to navigate the world. If you and I were a pair of lions on the Serengeti, and we were trying to decide the strongest lion, it would be most foolish ─ for both of us ─ to plunge straight into a conflict. It is far better for each of us to make a show of strength, to tell the story of how our victory is inevitable. If one of those stories is much more convincing than the other, we might be able to agree on the outcome without actually having the fight."

Although war dances risk warning an enemy of an upcoming attack, the arousal and synchronizing benefits for the attackers may compensate for the loss of surprise. Humans who sang, danced, and marched may have enjoyed a strong advantage on the battlefield as well as intimidated enemies who witnessed such a spectacle. Nineteenth-and twentieth-century Germans feared no one more than the Scots — the bagpipes and drums were disturbing in their sheer loudness and visual spectacle."

In some case a pre-emptive move may simply be an announcement of some intent that might discourage rivals from doing the same. The idea of pre-emption implies that timing is sometimes very important ― a decision or an action at one point in time might be much more rewarding than doing it at a different time point. Pre-emption may involve up-weighting advertising for a period before and during when a new entrant launches into a market. The intent is to make it more difficult for the new entrant's advertising to make an impression on potential buyers. Product proliferation is another potential pre-emption strategy. The general idea is to launch a large variety of product variants so that there is very little in the way of market demand that is not accommodated. Arguably, if a market is already filled with product variants it is more difficult for competitors to find untapped pockets of market demand."

Organisms only learn when events violate their expectations. In other words, surprise is one of the fundamental drivers of learning. Imagine hearing a series of identical notes, AAAAA. Each note draws out a response in the auditory areas of your brain — but as the notes repeat, those responses progressively decrease. This is called “adaptation,” a deceptively simple phenomenon that shows that your brain is learning to anticipate the next event. Suddenly, the note changes: AAAAA#. Your primary auditory cortex immediately shows a strong surprise reaction: not only does the adaptation fade away, but additional neurons begin to vigorously fire in response to the unexpected sound. And it is not just repetition that leads to adaptation: what matters is whether the notes are predictable. For instance, if you hear an alternating set of notes, such as ABABA, your brain gets used to this alternation, and the activity in your auditory areas again decreases. This time, however, it is an unexpected repetition, such as ABABB, that triggers a surprise response."

Humans live different lifestyles and in different environments. Thus, they are insufficiently homogeneous to be suitable experimental subjects. These confounding factors undermine our ability to draw sound causal conclusions from human epidemiological surveys. Confounding factors are variables (known or unknown) that make it difficult for epidemiologists to isolate the effects of the specific variable being studied. For example, Taubes argued that since many people who drink also smoke, researchers have difficulty determining the link between alcohol consumption and cancer. Similarly, researchers in the famous Framingham study identified a significant correlation between coffee drinking and coronary heart disease. However, most of this correlation disappeared once researchers corrected for the fact that many coffee drinkers also smoke. If the confounding factors are known, it is often possible to correct for them.

Not only is it painful to admit this inferiority, but it is even worse for others to see that we are feeling this. And so almost as soon as we experience the initial feelings of envy, we are motivated to disguise it to ourselves — it is not envy we feel but unfairness at the distribution of goods or attention, resentment at this unfairness, even anger."

To argue, for instance, that the baby boom and then the baby bust resulted from an increase and then a decrease in the public’s inherent taste for children, rather than a change in relative prices against a background of stable preferences, places a social scientist in an unsound position. In economics, such an argument about birth rates would be equivalent to saying that a rise and fall in mortality could be attributed to an increase in the inherent desire change for death. For an economist, changes in income and prices, rather than changes in tastes, affect birth rates. When income rises, for example, people want more children (or, as you will see later, more satisfaction derived from children), even if their inherent desire for children stays the same."

Dr. Steven Gundry justifies this as part of our genetic programming, our inner intelligence.

The right to privacy is, among other things, the right for information traditionally regarded as protected or personal not to be revealed. The right to be forgotten, in contrast, can be applied to information that has been in the public domain. The right to be forgotten broadly includes the right of an individual not to be forever defined by information from a specific point in time. One motivation for such a right is to allow individuals to move on with their lives and not be defined by a specific event or period in their lives. For example, it has long been recognized in some countries, such as the UK and France, that even past criminal convictions should eventually be “spent” and not continue to affect a person’s life. Despite the reason for supporting the right to be forgotten, the right to be forgotten can sometimes come into conflict with other rights.

It makes our planet slightly stretched out along the line of sight to the Moon and slightly compressed along a line perpendicular to that. The tidal stretching caused by the Moon's gravity affects our entire planet, including both land and water, inside and out. However, the rigidity of rock means that land rises and falls with the tides by a much smaller amount than water, which is why we notice only the ocean tides. The stretching also explains why there are generally two high tides (and two low tides) in the ocean each day. Because Earth is stretched much like a rubber band, the oceans bulge out both on the side facing toward the Moon and on the side facing away from the Moon. As Earth rotates, we are carried through both of these tidal bulges each day, so we have high tide when we are in each of the two bulges and low tide at the midpoints in between."

Gazzaniga then asked participants why they chose the card that they did. Because language is processed and generated in the left hemisphere, the left hemisphere is required to respond. However, because of the experiment’s design, only the right hemisphere knew why the participant selected the card. As a result, Gazzaniga expected the participants to be silent when asked to answer the question. But instead, every subject fabricated a response. The left hemisphere was being asked to provide a rationalization for a behavior done by the right hemisphere. The left hemisphere didn’t know the answer. But that didn’t keep it from fabricating an answer. That answer, however, had no basis in reality. Now if this study had been limited to split-brain patients, it would be interesting but not very relevant to us. It turns out split-brain patients aren’t the only ones who fabricate reasons. We all do it. We all need a coherent story about ourselves, and when information in that story is missing, our brains simply fill in the details."

She decided not to pass the ball to her twin sister, Vasha. Instead, she stopped, jumped, and shot the ball toward the basket, but it bounced off the backboard. Chanel could see that her teammates were disappointed. The other team got the ball and soon scored, ending the game. When the practice game ended, Chanel felt her eyes sting with tears. “It’s okay,” Vasha said in a comforting voice. Chanel appreciated her, but Vasha wasn’t making her feel any better. Vasha wanted to help her twin improve. She invited her twin to practice with her. After school, they got their basketball and started practicing their basketball shots. At first, Chanel did not like practicing with Vasha because every time Vasha shot the ball, it went in. But whenever it was Chanel’s turn, she missed. She got frustrated at not making a shot. “Don’t give up!” Vasha shouted after each missed shot. After twelve misses in a row, her thirteenth shot went in and she screamed, “I finally did it!” Her twin said, “I knew you could! Now let’s keep practicing!” The next day, Chanel played in the championship game against a rival school. It was an intense game and the score was tied when Chanel was passed the ball by Vasha, with ten seconds left in the game. She leaped into the air and shot the ball. It went straight into the basket! Chanel’s last shot had made her team the champions. Vasha and all her other teammates cheered for her."

The French historian Jacques Le Goff called the birth of the public mechanical clock a turning point in Western society. Until the late Middle Ages, people had sun or water clocks, which did not play any meaningful role in business activities. Market openings and activities started with the sunrise and typically ended at noon when the sun was at its peak. But when the first public mechanical clocks were introduced and spread across European cities, market times were set by the stroke of the hour. Public clocks thus greatly contributed to public life and work by providing a new concept of time that was easy for everyone to understand. This, in turn, helped facilitate trade and commerce. Interactions and transactions between consumers, retailers, and wholesalers became less irregular. Important town meetings began to follow the pace of the clock, allowing people to better plan their time and allocate resources in a more efficient manner."

It was an excellent device that would make it easy for shoppers to buy as much as they wanted without getting tired or seeking others' help. But Goldman discovered that in spite of his repeated advertisements and explanations, he could not persuade his shoppers to use the wheeled carts. Men were reluctant because they thought they would appear weak if they pushed such carts instead of carrying their shopping. Women wouldn't touch them because the carts reminded them of baby carriages. It was only a few elderly shoppers who used them. That made the carts even less attractive to the majority of the shoppers. Then Goldman hit upon an idea. He hired several models, men and women, of different ages and asked them to wheel the carts in the store and shop. A young woman employee standing near the entrance told the regular shoppers, 'Look, everyone is using the carts. Why don't you?' That was the turning point. A few shills disguised as regular shoppers easily accomplished what logic, explanations, and advertisements failed to do. Within a few weeks shoppers readily accepted those carts."

Even if deception is sometimes allowed when it serves worthy goals, should it be allowed for vulnerable users? Just as children on the autism spectrum with robot companions might be easily fooled into thinking of robots as friends, older adults with cognitive deficits might be. According to Alexis Elder, a professor at UMD, robots are false friends, inferior to true friendship. Reasoning along similar lines, John Sullins, a professor at Sonoma State University, holds that robots should ""remain iconic or cartoonish so that they are easily distinguished as synthetic even by unsophisticated users."" At least then no one is fooled. Making robots clearly fake also avoids the so-called ""uncanny valley,"" where robots are perceived as scary because they so closely resemble us, but not quite. Other critics of robot deception argue that when care recipients are deceived into thinking that robots care, this crosses a line and violates human dignity."

The lectins in most plants bind to carbohydrates as we consume the plant. They also bind to sugar molecules found in the gut, in the brain, between nerve endings, in joints and in all bodily fluids. According to Dr. Steven Gundry, these sticky proteins can interrupt messaging between cells and cause toxic and inflammatory reactions. Brain fog is just one result of lectins interrupting communication between nerves. An upset stomach is another common symptom of lectin overload. Dr. Gundry lists a wide range of other health problems including aching joints, dementia, headaches and infertility that have been resolved in his patients once they eliminated lectins from their diets. Dr. Paul Saladino writes that the hypothesis that lectins are involved in Parkinson's disease is also gaining support, with animal studies showing that 'lectins, once eaten, may be damaging the gut and travelling to the brain, where they appear to be toxic to dopaminergic neurons'."

Glorious miracles have been later on discovered to be obedience to the laws of nature or a technological development that was not widely known at the time. As the German poet, Goethe, phrased it: ""Things that are mysterious are not yet miracles."" The miracle assumes the intervention of a ""higher power"" in its occurrence that is beyond human capability to grasp. Yet there are methodical and simple ways to ""cause a miracle"" without divine revelation and inspiration. Instead of checking it out, investigating and finding the source of the event, we define it as a miracle. The miracle, then, is the excuse of those who are too lazy to think."

External information can easily integrate into a witness's memory, especially if the event was poorly encoded or the memory is from a distant event, in which case time and forgetting have degraded the original memory. With reduced information available in memory with which to confirm the validity of post-event misinformation, it is less likely that this new information will be rejected. Instead, especially when it fits the witness's current thinking and can be used to create a story that makes sense to him or her, it may be integrated as part of the original experience. This process can be explicit (i.e., the witness knows it is happening), but it is often unconscious. That is, the witness might find himself or herself thinking about the event differently without awareness. Over time, the witness may not even know the source of information that led to the (new) memory.

These insights are often covered up when we bring causality back into the picture. For instance, a used-car dealer supplied data to statisticians to predict which of the vehicles available for purchase at an auction were likely to have problems. A correlation analysis showed that orange-colored cars were far less likely to have defects. Even as we read this, we already think about why it might be so: Are orange-colored car owners likely to be car enthusiasts and take better care of their vehicles? Or, is it because orange-colored cars are more noticeable on the road and therefore less likely to be in accidents, so they're in better condition when resold? Quickly we are caught in a web of competing causal hypotheses. But our attempts to illuminate things this way only make them cloudier. Correlations exist; we can show them mathematically. We can't easily do the same for causal links. So we would do well to hold off from trying to explain the reason behind the correlations."

That is why nature has made mice to live, on average, for no longer than two years. Now we have arrived at an important point: The average life span of an animal species, or the rate at which it ages, is determined by the average time that this animal species can survive in the wild. That explains why a bat can live to be 30 years old. In contrast to mice, bats can fly, which is why they can escape from danger much faster. Thanks to their wings, bats can also cover longer distances and are better able to find food. Every genetic change in the past that made it possible for a bat to live longer was useful, because bats are much better able than mice to flee from danger, find food, and survive."

Freud suggested that we don't change our personality much after age five or thereabouts, but as in many other things, Freud was wrong. Recent psychological research shows that personality traits stabilize around age thirty in both men and women and regardless of ethnicity as the human brain continues to develop, both neuroanatomically and in terms of cognitive skills, until the mid-twenties. The advantage of this new understanding is that we can be a bit more optimistic than Aristotle and Freud about being able to teach moral excellence."

People who contributed more to the group fund were given responsibility for more money than people who contributed less. Similar results have been found by other researchers.

Having the full (or close to the full) dataset provides a lot more freedom to explore, to look at the data from different angles or to look closer at certain aspects of it. A fitting example may be the light-field camera, which captures not just a single plane of light, as with conventional cameras, but rays from the entire light field, some 11 million of them. The photographers can decide later which element of an image to focus on in the digital file. There is no need to focus at the beginning, since collecting all the information makes it possible to do that afterwards. Because rays from the entire light field are included, it is closer to all the data. As a result, the information is more ""reuseable"" than ordinary pictures, where the photographer has to decide what to focus on before she presses the shutter."

Regent University found that a desire to be of service to others and to empower them to grow, which is more common among introverts than extroverts, is a key factor in becoming a leader and retaining leadership. So-called servant leadership, dating back to ancient philosophical literature, adheres to the belief that a company's goals are best achieved by helping workers or customers achieve their goals.

A news article that’s intended to warn people about increasing cancer rates, for example, can result in fewer people choosing to get screened for the disease because they’re so terrified of what they might find.

It works like this: As the glaciers melt and the seas rise, gravity forces more water toward the equator. This changes the shape of the Earth ever so slightly, making it fatter around the middle, which in turns slows the rotation of the planet similarly to the way a ballet dancer slows her spin by spreading out her arms. The slowdown isn’t much, just a few thousandths of a second each year, but like the barely noticeable jump of rising seas every year, it adds up. When dinosaurs lived on the Earth, a day lasted only about twenty-three hours."

In fact, curiosity is associated with a less defensive reaction to stress and, as a result, less aggression when we respond to irritation."

The largest percentage point difference between the two groups is in animal welfare, whereas the smallest difference is in environment. The percentage of non-meat eaters citing taste is three times higher than that of people interested in reducing their meat consumption citing taste.

After her father died, Knight’s family moved to Manchester. Knight left school in 1850, at age 12, to earn money for her family at a nearby textile factory, where she witnessed a fellow worker injured by faulty equipment. That led her to create her first invention, a safety device for textile equipment, but she never earned money from the invention. She also invented a machine that cut, folded and glued flat-bottomed paper bags and was awarded her first patent in 1871 for it. It eliminated the need for workers to assemble them slowly by hand. Knight received 27 patents in her lifetime and entered the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006."

Auxins produced at the tips of stems tend to accumulate on the side of the stem that is in the shade. Accordingly, the auxins stimulate growth on the shaded side of the plant. Therefore, the shaded side grows faster than the side facing the sunlight. This phenomenon causes the stem to bend and appear to be growing towards the light. Auxins have the opposite effect on the roots of plants. Auxins in the tips of roots tend to limit growth. If a root is horizontal in the soil, the auxins will accumulate on the lower side and interfere with its development. Therefore, the lower side of the root will grow slower than the upper side. This will, in turn, cause the root to bend downwards, with the tip of the root growing in that direction."

He assigned all classes three reports over the course of the semester. The first class had to choose three due dates for themselves, up to and including the last day of class. The second had no deadlines — all three papers just had to be submitted by the last day of class. In his third class, he gave students three set deadlines over the course of the semester. At the end of the semester, he found that students with set deadlines received the best grades, the students with no deadlines had the worst, and those who could choose their own deadlines fell somewhere in the middle. Ariely concludes that restricting freedom—whether by the professor or by students who recognize their own tendencies to delay things — improves self-control and performance."

Analytic philosophy historically assumes that language is basic and that mind would make sense if proper use of language was appreciated. Modern cognitive science, however, rightly judges that language is just one aspect of mind of great importance in human beings but not fundamental to all kinds of thinking. Countless species of animals manage to navigate the world, solve problems, and learn without using language, through brain mechanisms that are largely preserved in the minds of humans. There is no reason to assume that language is fundamental to mental operations. Nevertheless, language is enormously important in human life and contributes largely to our ability to cooperate with each other in dealing with the world.

However, the rate is the same. Whether they are thick or thin, all the trees of the same species are using light to produce the same amount of sugar per leaf. Some trees have plenty of sugar and some have less, but the trees equalize this difference between them by transferring sugar. This is taking place underground through the roots. Whoever has an abundance of sugar hands some over; whoever is running short gets help. Their network acts as a system to make sure that no trees fall too far behind."

Three weeks later, the students who had written about their values were happier, healthier, and more confident about their ability to handle stress than the ones who had only focused on the good stuff. By reflecting on how their daily activities supported their values, students had gained a new perspective on those activities and choices.

A genuine smile will impact on the muscles and wrinkles around the eyes and less noticeably, the skin between the eyebrow and upper eyelid is lowered slightly with true enjoyment. The genuine smile can impact on the entire face."

However, moral reasoning and good sporting behavior seem to decline as athletes progress to higher competitive levels, in part because of the increased emphasis on winning. Thus winning can be a double-edged sword in teaching character development. Some athletes may want to win so much that they lie, cheat, and break team rules. They may develop undesirable character traits that can enhance their ability to win in the short term. However, when athletes resist the temptation to win in a dishonest way, they can develop positive character traits that last a lifetime. Character is a learned behavior, and a sense of fair play develops only if coaches plan to teach those lessons systematically."

Mass availability has given individuals unheard-of control over their own sound-environment. However, it has also confronted them with the simultaneous availability of countless genres of music, in which they have to orient themselves. People start filtering out and organizing their digital libraries like they used to do with their physical music collections. However, there is the difference that the choice lies in their own hands. Without being restricted to the limited collection of music-distributors, nor being guided by the local radio program as a ‘preselector’ of the latest hits, the individual actively has to choose and determine his or her musical preferences. The search for the right song is thus associated with considerable effort."

However, from a sociocultural standpoint, the creative act is never ""complete"" in the absence of a second position ― that of an audience. While the actor or creator him/herself is the first audience of the artifact being produced, this kind of distantiation can only be achieved by internalizing the perspective of others on one's work. This means that, in order to be an audience to your own creation, a history of interaction with others is needed. We exist in a social world that constantly confronts us with the ""view of the other."" It is the view we include and blend into our own activity, including creative activity. This outside perspective is essential for creativity because it gives new meaning and value to the creative act and its product."

An analogy often given for sound is that of throwing a small stone onto the surface of a still pond. Waves radiate outwards from the point of impact, just as sound waves radiate from the sound source. This is due to a disturbance in the air around us. If you bang two sticks together, you will get a sound. As the sticks approach each other, the air immediately in front of them is compressed and energy builds up. When the point of impact occurs, this energy is released as sound waves. If you try the same experiment with two heavy stones, exactly the same thing occurs, but you get a different sound due to the density and surface of the stones, and as they have likely displaced more air, a louder sound. And so, a physical disturbance in the atmosphere around us will produce a sound."

In a grassland, grass is eaten by rabbits while rabbits in turn are eaten by foxes. This is an example of a simple food chain. This food chain implies the sequence in which food energy is transferred from producer to consumer or higher trophic level. It has been observed that at each level of transfer, a large proportion, 80-90 percent, of the potential energy is lost as heat. Hence the number of steps or links in a sequence is restricted, usually to four or five. The shorter the food chain or the nearer the organism is to the beginning of the chain, the greater the available energy intake is."

It would be easy to face a fear of standing on high balconies in a way that's totally controlled. Socializing is trickier. People aren't like inanimate features of a building that you just have to be around to get used to. You have to interact with them, and their responses can be unpredictable. Your feelings toward them are more complex too. Most people's self-esteem isn't going to be affected that much if they don't like balconies, but your confidence can suffer if you can't socialize effectively. It's also harder to design a tidy way to gradually face many social fears. The social situations you need to expose yourself to may not be available when you want them, or they may not go well enough for you to sense that things are under control. The progression from one step to the next may not be clear, creating unavoidable large increases in difficulty from one to the next. People around you aren't robots that you can endlessly experiment with for your own purposes. This is not to say that facing your fears is pointless when socializing. The principles of gradual exposure are still very useful. The process of applying them is just messier, and knowing that before you start is helpful."

Scientists were able to show this by having babies look at two simple images, one that looks more like a face than the other. By measuring where the babies looked, scientists found that the babies looked at the face-like image more than they looked at the non-face image. Even though babies have poor eyesight, they prefer to look at faces. But why? One reason babies might like faces is because of something called evolution. Evolution involves changes to the structures of an organism(such as the brain) that occur over many generations. These changes help the organisms to survive, making them alert to enemies. By being able to recognize faces from afar or in the dark, humans were able to know someone was coming and protect themselves from possible danger."

It was a classic tragedy-of-the-commons situation: because some people took more toilet paper than their fair share, the public resource was destroyed for everyone else.

Meat from a large game animal comes in quantities that exceed what a single hunter and his immediate family could possibly consume. Furthermore, hunting success is highly variable; a hunter who is successful one week might fail the next. These conditions encourage food sharing from hunting. The costs to a hunter of giving away meat he cannot eat immediately are low because he cannot consume all the meat himself and leftovers will soon spoil. The benefits can be large, however, when those who are given his food return the generous favor later on when he has failed to get food for himself.

Not only are complaints less expensive to handle but they also can cause the seller to improve. The seller may learn something as well. I remember a cosmetics company that received complaints about sticky sunblock lotion. At the time, all such lotions were more or less sticky, so the risk of having customers buy products from a rival company was not great. But this was also an opportunity. The company managed to develop a product that was not sticky and captured 20 percent of the market in its first year. Another company had the opposite problem. Its products were not sticky enough. The company was a Royal Post Office in Europe and the product was a stamp. The problem was that the stamp didn't stick to the envelope. Management contacted the stamp producer who made it clear that if people just moistened the stamps properly, they would stick to any piece of paper. What to do? Management didn't take long to come to the conclusion that it would be more costly to try to educate its customers to wet each stamp rather than to add more glue. The stamp producer was told to add more glue and the problem didn't occur again. Since it is better for the firm to have buyers complain rather than go elsewhere, it is important to make it easier for dissatisfied customers to complain."

Bluma Zeigarnik was a Lithuanian psychologist who wrote in the 1920s about the effects of leaving tasks incomplete. She noticed the effect while watching waiters serve in a restaurant. The waiters would remember an order, however complicated, until the order was complete, but they would later find it difficult to remember the order. Zeigarnik did further studies giving both adults and children puzzles to complete then interrupting them during some of the tasks. The results showed that both adults and children remembered the tasks that hadn't been completed because of the interruptions better than the ones that had been completed."

This rule works well in a monocultural setting, where everyone is working within the same cultural framework. In a multicultural setting, however, where words, gestures, beliefs, and views may have different meanings, this rule has an unintended result; it can send a message that my culture is better than yours.It can also create a frustrating situation where we believe we are doing what is right, but what we are doing is not being interpreted in the way in which it was meant.

However, using caffeine to improve alertness and mental performance doesn't replace getting a good night's sleep. One study from 2018 showed that coffee improved reaction times in those with or without poor sleep, but caffeine seemed to increase errors in the group with little sleep.

The noise, of course, interrupted anything and everything happening in the office because it was unbelievably loud. However, it had an amazingly positive impact on everyone.

For many actors, they experience greater empathy and social cognition for their character, which may intensify identity boundary blurring. As well, actors tend to employ more dissociative processes, which increase potential character boundary blurring. Actors also experience more unresolved mourning for past trauma and loss experiences because they continually draw from these experiences when portraying characters. Adding to this tendency to merge with the creative work, audience members also confuse the character's personality with the actor's personality.

Repression and neutralization through metaphor are possible strategies, but there is another. Faced with the moving clouds, the child can theorize about their movement in such a way that the clouds cease to be alive. “Cloud movement” becomes differentiated from the kind of movement that makes things alive, because the clouds move only if they are “pushed” by the wind, and what can’t move without a push from the outside is not alive. Children develop theoretical constructs that separate the motion of clouds from the motion of people and animals so that eventually the fear of living clouds disappears. If things seem uncomfortably on the border between the alive and the not‐alive, use logic to redefine the boundaries so that things fall more comfortably into place. If it scares you, make a theory."

If a farmer has more grain than he can eat, and a herder has more milk than he can drink, both of them come out ahead if they trade some wheat for some milk. As they say, everybody wins. Of course, an exchange at a single moment in time only pays when there is a division of labor. There would be no point in one farmer giving a bushel of wheat to another farmer and receiving a bushel of wheat in return. A fundamental insight of modern economics is that the key to the creation of wealth is a division of labor, in which specialists learn to produce a commodity with increasing cost-effectiveness and have the means to exchange their specialized products efficiently. One infrastructure that allows efficient exchange is transportation, which makes it possible for producers to trade their surpluses even when they are separated by distance. Another is money, interest, and middlemen, which allow producers to exchange many kinds of surpluses with many other producers at many points in time."

If our runner was running into a headwind, her speed would be reduced, as some of her force would be needed to overcome the additional obstacle of the wind. On the contrary, if she had a tailwind her performance would be enhanced and movement assisted by the wind. Let us also consider other surrounding circumstances, such as what is motivating the athlete to run.

It's also important to remember that the data recorded at a weather station give an indication of conditions prevailing in an area but will not be exactly the same as the conditions at a landscape some distance from the weather station."

Knowing that he was the only person living in the house, he was always prepared in case thieves came to his house. So, one day, when a thief entered his home, he remained calm and cool. Although he was awake, the merchant pretended to be in a deep sleep. He lay in bed and watched the thief in action. The thief had brought a new white sheet with him to carry away the stolen goods. He spread it out on the floor with the idea of putting all the stolen valuables into it, tying it, and carrying it away. While he was busy gathering expensive-looking items from the merchant’s luxurious house, the merchant quickly got out of the bed. Then he replaced the new white sheet with a similar looking white sheet, which was much weaker and much cheaper than the thief’s one. He then lay down and pretended to be asleep. When the thief had finished collecting as many valuables as he could, he hurriedly tied a knot in the white sheet which he thought was his. The merchant meanwhile ran out into the garden and yelled ― “Thief! Thief!” with all the air in his lungs. The thief got nervous and quickly lifted the sheet. To his surprise, the thin white sheet, filled with stolen goods, was torn apart. All the stolen goods fell down on the floor creating a very loud and unpleasant noise. Seeing many people run towards him, the thief had to give up on all of the stolen goods. Leaving the goods behind in the house, he ran away in a hurry saying under his breath: “This man is such a skillful merchant; he is a businessman to the core. He has not only managed to save his valuables but has also taken away my new sheet. He has stolen from a thief!” As he said that to himself, he ran away from the house."

The Woodridge Children's Theater has been the pride of our community since 1975. My daughter Katie has been participating in the theater's activities for six years. The theater has meant so much to so many in our community. However, I have been made aware that you are considering cutting the budget of the theater. The experiences and life lessons children gain at the theater are invaluable. Not only do kids learn about the arts there, but they also learn skills that will last for a lifetime. To reduce funding would be a huge loss to future generations and thus I strongly object to it. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. Sincerely, Celina Evans"

""And how did you arrive at that figure?"" The third young man, like the other two, had been hired for the same job and had put in equal time. ""Well,"" said Nathan, ""I didn't charge you for the lunch break since your wife prepared and served lunch. I didn't have gas expenses since I came with my buddies. So the actual number of hours worked brings my pay to thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents."" My father wrote him out a check for one hundred dollars. Dad then looked at the three young men ― stricken silent by my father's actions ― all of whom were a bit bewildered by the differing amounts on their individual check. ""I always pay a man his worth, boys. Where I come from we call that equal pay for equal worth."" He looked benevolently at the three young men and in his typical fatherly style added, ""The values in a man create the value of a man."""

He demonstrated that bats emit high-frequency sounds with which they can locate objects as small as flying insects. In 1965, he became a professor at Rockefeller University in New York and a research zoologist for the New York Zoological Society. After he retired from Rockefeller University in 1986, he didn't stop his research: he continued to present papers at national and international meetings. In the late 1970s Griffin argued that animals might possess the ability to think and reason.

Recovery programs are established to coordinate the efforts of field conservationists and wildlife authorities. As populations of those species diminish it is not unusual for zoos to start captive breeding programs. Captive breeding acts to protect against extinction. In some cases captive-bred individuals may be released back into the wild, supplementing wild populations. This is most successful in situations where individuals are at greatest threat during a particular life stage. For example, turtle eggs may be removed from high-risk locations until after they hatch. This may increase the number of turtles that survive to adulthood. Crocodile programs have also been successful in protecting eggs and hatchlings, releasing hatchlings once they are better equipped to protect themselves."

Ultimately, though, the advantages of using woven fabric for clothing would have become obvious. A fur pelt offers adequate thermal protection if someone is sitting still, but once on the move or in strong winds, this is less true, because pelts aren't shaped close to the body. The more air gets between the body and the clothing, the less effective it is at trapping an insulating layer of air close to the skin. In fact, the insulating properties of clothing decrease very much when walking quickly. Clothing also needs to be breathable, because damp clothes are bad at keeping the wearer warm and become very heavy. Woven fabrics are more breathable than fur and, when specifically tailored to the body, make excellent internal layers, preventing cold air from getting direct access to the skin's surface. Thus the ability to create woven clothing would have offered material advantages to our early ancestors once they had left Africa for cooler areas."

As far as the fungi are concerned, this is the invitation they have been waiting for, because usually they can't get past the bark. In this case, the fungi quickly move into the opening and begin to break down the wood. What the tree sees as a coordinated attack, the woodpecker sees as a division of labor.

Consider, for instance, the development of new digital audio formats such as MP3 and AAC. Various media feed us daily with data-compressed audio, and some people rarely experience CD-quality (that is, technical quality) audio. This tendency could lead to a new generation of listeners with other sound quality preferences. Research by Stanford University professor Jonathan Berger adds fuel to this thesis. Berger tested first-year university students' preferences for MP3s annually for ten years. He reports that each year more and more students come to prefer MP3s to CD-quality audio. These findings indicate that listeners gradually become accustomed to data-compressed formats and change their listening preferences accordingly. The point is that while technical improvements strive toward increased sound quality in a technical sense (e.g., higher resolution and greater bit rate), listeners' expectations do not necessarily follow the same path. As a result, ""improved"" technical digital sound quality may in some cases lead to a decrease in the perceptual worth of the sound."

In the 18th century, on the contrary, once the particular occasion for performing a new piece was over, it became almost impossible to ever hear it again. Under such circumstances, recycling previously composed music was the only way to make it more durable. And if new pieces also contained ideas from other composers, that would re-enforce European musical traditions by increasing the circulation of melodies and harmonic patterns people loved to hear."

In a very telling experiment done by evolutionary psychologist Mike Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, a puzzle box containing a treat is given to a human toddler and a chimpanzee. Neither is able to get the treat out. He then demonstrates a multistep process of pulling and pushing pegs that eventually releases the treat. Among the motions, he includes an obviously nonsensical step ― patting his head three times before the last step. Both the toddler and the chimp are able to copy his actions and get the treat, but only the toddler includes the head-patting step. The chimp, seeing this is not relevant to getting the treat, omits it from the routine. The human, however, unquestioningly copies all the steps. The toddler trusts the human teaching her to have a reason for each step in this situation, and so she overcopies. In fact, the less clear the goal of the procedure, the more carefully and precisely the human child will imitate even irrelevant steps."

The decrease occurs because there is a transfer of molecules from the liquid to the vapor phase. However, as the number of vapor molecules increases, it becomes more and more likely that some of them will return to the liquid. The process by which vapor molecules form a liquid is called condensation. Eventually, the same number of molecules are leaving the liquid as are returning to it: the rate of condensation equals the rate of evaporation. At this point no further change occurs in the amounts of liquid or vapor, because the two opposite processes exactly balance each other; the system is at equilibrium. Note that this system is highly dynamic on the molecular level. Molecules are constantly escaping from and entering the liquid. However, there is no net change because the two processes just balance each other. As an analogy, consider two island cities connected by a bridge. Suppose the traffic flow on the bridge is the same in both directions. There is motion — we can see the cars traveling across the bridge — but the number of cars in each city is not changing because an equal number enter and leave each one. The result is no net change in the number of autos in each city: an equilibrium exists."

Cheryl's sister promised herself that one day she would make Cheryl's dream come true. She soon found an opportunity to do so.

She went back home and broke the news to Cheryl. Thanks to her sister, Cheryl got the chance to sing in the festival. Cheryl was overjoyed and began to practice for her performance. The day of the festival came, and Cheryl arrived at the concert hall with her family. Cheryl could not see, but she could sense the energy of the packed hall. Finally it was her turn to take her position on stage. Terrified, she hesitated to begin her song. But after everything her sister had done to give her this chance, she knew she had to go on. When Cheryl finished singing, the hall was silent for a moment before exploding into applause. She went back home, overwhelmed that her dream was now fulfilled. To add to it all, her sister had recorded the whole performance for her to listen to in the future.

Part of the problem may be that the majority of the people who are most likely to write novels, plays, and film scripts were educated in the humanities, not in the sciences. Furthermore, the few scientists-turned-writers have used their scientific training as the source material for thrillers that further damage the image of science and scientists. We need more screenplays and novels that present scientists in a positive light.

Moreover, the total energy is always conserved. But while the total energy remains unchanged, the kinetic and potential parts of the total energy can change all the time. Imagine, for example, a pendulum which swings back and forth. When it swings, it sweeps out an arc and then slows down as it comes closer to its highest point, where the pendulum does not move at all. So at this point, the energy is completely given in terms of potential energy. But after this brief moment of rest, the pendulum swings back again and therefore part of the total energy is then given in the form of kinetic energy.

But the more science has learned about the body and its interaction with the environment around it (in its various forms, from our nutrition to our relationships to our racially oppressive systems), the more complicated the story becomes. We are not merely expressions of coding but products of a remarkable variety of interactions that are both within and outside of our control. Once we see beyond the narrative that genetics are destiny, we can take ownership of our health.

For that reason, they had the fond conceit of primeval nature uncontrolled by human associations which could later find expression in an admiration for wilderness. Ecological relationships certainly have their own logic and in this sense 'nature' can be seen to have a self-regulating but not necessarily stable dynamic independent of human intervention.

Despite the large and complex song repertoire of European robins, they were able to discriminate between the songs of neighbors and strangers. When they heard a tape recording of a stranger, they began to sing sooner, sang more songs, and overlapped their songs with the playback more often than they did on hearing a neighbor's song. As Brindley suggests, the overlapping of song may be an aggressive response. However, this difference in responding to neighbor versus stranger occurred only when the neighbor's song was played by a loudspeaker placed at the boundary between that neighbor's territory and the territory of the bird being tested. If the same neighbor's song was played at another boundary, one separating the territory of the test subject from another neighbor, it was treated as the call of a stranger. Not only does this result demonstrate that the robins associate locality with familiar songs, but it also shows that the choice of songs used in playback experiments is highly important."

Eugene Litwak has referred to this pattern of behaviour as the 'modified extended family'. It is an extended family structure because multigenerational ties are maintained, but it is modified because it does not usually rest on co-residence between the generations and most extended families do not act as corporate groups. Although modified extended family members often live close by, the modified extended family does not require geographical proximity and ties are maintained even when kin are separated by considerable distances. In contrast to the traditional extended family where kin always live in close proximity, the members of modified extended families may freely move away from kin to seek opportunities for occupational advancement."

This isn't really a paradox: landmarks are themselves, but they also define neighborhoods around themselves. In a paradigm that has been repeated on many campuses, researchers first collect a list of campus landmarks from students. Then they ask another group of students to estimate the distances between pairs of locations, some to landmarks, some to ordinary buildings on campus. The remarkable finding is that distances from an ordinary location to a landmark are judged shorter than distances from a landmark to an ordinary location. So, people would judge the distance from Pierre's house to the Eiffel Tower to be shorter than the distance from the Eiffel Tower to Pierre's house. Like black holes, landmarks seem to pull ordinary locations toward themselves, but ordinary places do not. This asymmetry of distance estimates violates the most elementary principles of Euclidean distance, that the distance from A to B must be the same as the distance from B to A. Judgments of distance, then, are not necessarily coherent."

This is because the supervisor is responsible for the employee's performance, providing supervision, handing out assignments, and developing the employee. A problem, however, is that supervisors often work in locations apart from their employees and therefore are not able to observe their subordinates' performance. Should supervisors rate employees on performance dimensions they cannot observe? To eliminate this dilemma, more and more organizations are implementing assessments referred to as 360-degree evaluations. Employees are rated not only by their supervisors but by coworkers, clients or citizens, professionals in other agencies with whom they work, and subordinates. The reason for this approach is that often coworkers and clients or citizens have a greater opportunity to observe an employee's performance and are in a better position to evaluate many performance dimensions."

The broken scraps of debris that had littered the base of the hole are gone as well. And this is when he feels the horrifying truth of where he is: so deep underground that the climb down made the muscles in his legs and arms tremble. He is trapped. Brutally so. As if in a grave, in a tomb. Frightened, he claws at the tiles. He screams, not caring if someone hears; hoping they do and will cast him out."

As the water got rougher, she was forced to paddle harder to keep the waves from tossing her into the water. Her friends Mia and Rebecca were paddling eagerly behind her to balance the boat. They were soaked from all of the spray. Mia shouted to Sophia, ""Are you OK? Aren't you scared?"" ""I'm great!"" Sophia shouted back excitedly. Even though the boat was getting thrown around, the girls managed to avoid hitting any rocks. Suddenly, almost as quickly as the water had got rougher, the river seemed to calm down, and they all felt relaxed. With a sigh of relief, Sophia looked around. ""Wow! What a wonderful view!"" she shouted. The scenery around them was breathtaking. Everyone was speechless. As they enjoyed the emerald green Rocky Mountains, Mia said, ""No wonder rafting is the best thing to do in Colorado!"" Agreeing with her friend, Rebecca gave a thumbs-up.

During the Indian cholera epidemic of 1893, at the invitation of the Government of India he went to Calcutta and introduced his vaccine. After initial criticism by the local medical bodies, it was widely accepted. Haffkine was appointed as the director of the Plague Laboratory in Bombay (now called the Haffkine Institute).

Economists such as Duncan Ironmonger have attempted to impute a dollar value on volunteering to enable its 'economic' value to be counted. Yet despite this, unpaid work and volunteering still remain outside the defined economic framework of our capitalist system because capitalism has competition and financial reward as its cornerstones and volunteering does not. Having said that, it has been estimated that volunteering contributes about $42 billion a year to the Australian economy. Although attempts to quantify and qualify the financial importance of volunteering in supporting our economic structures and enhancing our social capital continue to be made, it is slow going.

Selective exposure is a psychological concept that says people seek out information that conforms to their existing belief systems and avoid information that challenges those beliefs. In the past when there were few sources of news, people could either expose themselves to mainstream news ― where they would likely see beliefs expressed counter to their own ― or they could avoid news altogether. Now with so many types of news constantly available to a full range of niche audiences, people can easily find a source of news that consistently confirms their own personal set of beliefs.

Because he had spent the majority of his life adapting to being blind—and even cultivating a skiing career in this state—his other senses compensated by growing stronger. However, when his sight was restored through a surgery in his forties, his entire perception of reality was disrupted. Instead of being thrilled that he could see now, as he’d expected, his brain was so overloaded with new visual stimuli that the world became a frightening and overwhelming place. After he’d learned to know his family through touch and smell, he found that he couldn’t recognize his children with his eyes, and this left him puzzled. Skiing also became a lot harder as he struggled to adapt to the visual stimulation. This confusion occurred because his brain hadn’t yet learned to see. Though we often tend to assume our eyes function as video cameras which relay information to our brain, advances in neuroscientific research have proven that this is actually not the case. Instead, sight is a collaborative effort between our eyes and our brains, and the way we process visual reality depends on the way these two communicate. If communication between our eyes and our brains is disturbed, our perception of reality is altered accordingly. And because other areas of May’s brain had adapted to process information primarily through his other senses, the process of learning how to see was more difficult than he’d anticipated."

The puzzle was that in the twentieth century, there were prolonged periods where the reverse appeared to happen in the world of work. In some countries, there was huge growth in the number of high-skilled people pouring out of colleges and universities, yet their wages appeared to rise rather than fall compared to those without this education. How could this be? The supply of high-skilled workers did grow, pushing their wages downward, but new technologies were skill-biased and so caused the demand for high-skilled workers to soar. The latter effect was so great that it overcame the former, so even though there were more educated people looking for work, the demand for them was so strong that the amount they were paid still went up."

And why only the extremities? Despite its appearance, your skin isn't shrinking after your bath. Actually, it is expanding. The skin on the fingers, palms, toes, and soles wrinkles only after it is soaked with water. The stratum corneum ― the thick, dead, rough layer of the skin that protects us from the environment and that makes the skin on our hands and feet tougher and thicker than that on our stomachs or faces ― expands when it soaks up water. This expansion causes the wrinkling effect. So why doesn't the skin on other parts of the body also wrinkle when soaked? Actually, it does, but there is more room for the moisture to be absorbed in these less densely packed areas before it shows. One doctor we contacted said that soldiers whose feet are submerged in wet boots for a long period will exhibit wrinkling all over the covered area."

He was black. In 1967, Sayers' teammate in the backfield was another great running back by the name of Brian Piccolo. Piccolo was white. Blacks and whites often played on the same professional teams, but these two athletes were different. They were roommates on away games, which was a first for race relations in professional football. Sayers had never had a close relationship with any white man before, except with George Halas, the head coach of the Bears. And Piccolo admitted that he had never really known a black person during his lifetime. These two athletes became friends immediately and grew exceptionally close. During the 1969 season, Brian Piccolo was diagnosed as having cancer. Although he fought to play out the season, Piccolo was in the hospital more than he was on the playing field. It was during this time when Piccolo was battling his illness and fighting the daily depths of depression, that these two athletes shared a very special relationship. Frequently, Sayers flew to be at the bedside of his friend, as the cancer gripped Piccolo's weakened body tighter and tighter. Sayers and Piccolo, and their wives, had made plans to sit together at the annual Professional Football Writers' Banquet in New York, where Gayle Sayers was to receive the George S. Halas award as ""the most courageous player in professional football."" By the time of the banquet, Piccolo was too sick to attend. When Sayers stood to receive his award at the banquet, tears began to flow. Sayers, choking through his tears, said, ""You flatter me by giving me this award, but I tell you that I accept this award not for me, but for Brian Piccolo. However, Brian cannot be here tonight. He is too ill. But he is a man who has more courage than any of us here tonight."" Shortly after that memorable night, Brian Piccolo died. His memory will forever be etched in the heart of Gayle Sayers. Piccolo and Sayers had cultivated more than a superficial, tough-guy relationship. Although tough and competitive men to the core, a true and caring love had developed between these two strong athletes."

Society's granting of power and privilege to the professions is premised on their willingness and ability to contribute to social well-being and to conduct their affairs in a manner consistent with broader social values. It has long been recognized that the expertise and privileged position of professionals confer authority and power that could readily be used to advance their own interests at the expense of those they serve. As Edmund Burke observed two centuries ago, ""Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites.""

Insofar as they agree with the underlying concept or idea - thus possessing the precision that the ancient Greeks sought and celebrated - geometrical shapes can be grasped, but they do not give rise to emotion, and, most importantly, they do not move the imagination to free and new (mental) lengths. Forms or phenomena, on the contrary, that possess a degree of immeasurability, or that do not appear constrained, stimulate the human imagination - hence their ability to induce a sublime aesthetic experience. The pleasure associated with experiencing immeasurable objects - indefinable or formless objects - can be defined as enjoying one's own emotional and mental activity. Namely, the pleasure consists of being challenged and struggling to understand and decode the phenomenon present to view.

With this administrative management system, urban institutions of government have evolved to offer increasing levels of services to their citizenry, provided through a taxation process and/or fee for services (e.g., police and fire, street maintenance, utilities, waste management, etc.). Frequently this has displaced citizen involvement. Money for services is not a replacement for citizen responsibility and public participation. Responsibility of the citizen is slowly being supplanted by government being the substitute provider. Consequentially, there is a philosophical and social change in attitude and sense of responsibility of our urban-based society to become involved. The sense of community and associated responsibility of all citizens to be active participants is therefore diminishing. Governmental substitution for citizen duty and involvement can have serious implications. This impedes the nations of the world to be responsive to natural and man-made disasters as part of global preparedness."

For instance, a consumer buying a good in a store will likely trigger the replacement of this product, which will generate demands for activities such as manufacturing, resource extraction and, of course, transport. What is different about transport is that it cannot exist alone and a movement cannot be stored. An unsold product can remain on the shelf of a store until bought (often with discount incentives), but an unsold seat on a flight or unused cargo capacity in the same flight remains unsold and cannot be brought back as additional capacity later. In this case an opportunity has been missed, since the amount of transport being offered has exceeded the demand for it. The derived demand of transportation is often very difficult to reconcile with an equivalent supply, and actually transport companies would prefer to have some additional capacity to accommodate unforeseen demand (often at much higher prices)."

Many aspects of human culture have what archaeologists describe as low archaeological visibility, meaning they are difficult to identify archaeologically. Archaeologists tend to focus on tangible (or material) aspects of culture: things that can be handled and photographed, such as tools, food, and structures. Reconstructing intangible aspects of culture is more difficult, requiring that one draw more inferences from the tangible. It is relatively easy, for example, for archaeologists to identify and draw inferences about technology and diet from stone tools and food remains. Using the same kinds of physical remains to draw inferences about social systems and what people were thinking about is more difficult. Archaeologists do it, but there are necessarily more inferences involved in getting from physical remains recognized as trash to making interpretations about belief systems."

When the video came on, showing nature scenes with a musical soundtrack, the experimenter exclaimed that this was the wrong video and went supposedly to get the correct one, leaving the participant alone as the video played. The participants who had received failure feedback watched the video much longer than those who thought they had succeeded.

New ideas are discovered through logical reasoning, but such discoveries are inherent in and integral to the conceptual system and are made possible only because of the acceptance of its premises. For example, the discoveries of new prime numbers are 'real' consequences of the particular number system employed.

If persisted in, however, such careful behavior could interfere with feeding and other necessary activities to the extent that the benefit of caution would be lost. A turtle that withdraws into its shell at every puff of wind or whenever a cloud casts a shadow would never win races, not even with a lazy rabbit. To overcome this problem, almost all animals habituate to safe stimuli that occur frequently. Confronted by a strange object, an inexperienced animal may freeze or attempt to hide, but if nothing unpleasant happens, sooner or later it will continue its activity. The possibility also exists that an unfamiliar object may be useful, so if it poses no immediate threat, a closer inspection may be worthwhile."

Today, we have effectively domesticated ourselves and many of the tasks of survival ― from avoiding immediate death to building shelters to obtaining food ― have been outsourced to the wider society. We are smaller than our ancestors too, and it is a characteristic of domestic animals that they are generally smaller than their wild cousins.

Furthermore, it was discovered that the properties of a material could be altered by heat treatments and by the addition of other substances. At this point, materials utilization was totally a selection process that involved deciding from a given, rather limited set of materials, the one best suited for an application based on its characteristics. It was not until relatively recent times that scientists came to understand the relationships between the structural elements of materials and their properties. This knowledge, acquired over approximately the past 100 years, has empowered them to fashion, to a large degree, the characteristics of materials.

They might be motorized and can track the user around the room, giving the impression of being aware of the people in the environment. Although personal robotic assistants provide services similar to those of smart-home assistants, their social presence offers an opportunity that is unique to social robots.

These robots can be used as surveillance devices, act as communicative intermediates, engage in richer games, tell stories, or be used to provide encouragement or incentives."

Data can be stored in effectively unlimited quantities and in manageable form. The computer makes available a range of data unattainable in the age of books. It packages it effectively; style is no longer needed to make it accessible, nor is memorization. In dealing with a single decision separated from its context, the computer supplies tools unimaginable even a decade ago. But it also diminishes perspective. Because information is so accessible and communication instantaneous, there is a diminution of focus on its significance, or even on the definition of what is significant. This dynamic may encourage policymakers to wait for an issue to arise rather than anticipate it, and to regard moments of decision as a series of isolated events rather than part of a historical continuum. When this happens, manipulation of information replaces reflection as the principal policy tool."

While freshness is now being used as a term in food marketing as part of a return to nature, the demand for year-round supplies of fresh produce such as soft fruit and exotic vegetables has led to the widespread use of hot houses in cold climates and increasing reliance on total quality control ― management by temperature control, use of pesticides and computer/satellite-based logistics. The demand for freshness has also contributed to concerns about food wastage. Use of ‘best before’, ‘sell by’ and ‘eat by’ labels has legally allowed institutional waste. Campaigners have exposed the scandal of over-production and waste. Tristram Stuart, one of the global band of anti-waste campaigners, argues that, with freshly made sandwiches, over-ordering is standard practice across the retail sector to avoid the appearance of empty shelf space, leading to high volumes of waste when supply regularly exceeds demand."

In that class, Professor Brown said, ""You have to present your food properly, considering every stage of the dining experience. Imagine you are a photographer."" Recalling what the professor had mentioned, Katie said to herself, ""We need to see our ingredients as colors that make up a picture."" Sally could clearly see that Katie was having a hard time preparing for her cooking test. Trying to make her feel better, Sally kindly asked, ""Is there anything I can do to help?"" Katie, surprised by her roommate's words, turned her head to Sally and sighed, ""I don't know. This is really hard."" Stirring her sauce for pasta, Katie continued, ""Professor Brown said that visual aspects make up a key part of a meal. My recipe seems good, but I can't think of any ways to alter the feeling of the final dish."" Visibly frustrated, she was just about to throw away all of her hard work and start again, when Sally suddenly stopped her. ""Wait! You don't have to start over. You just need to add some color to the plate."" Being curious, Katie asked, ""How can I do that?"" Sally took out a container of vegetables from the refrigerator and replied, ""How about making colored pasta to go with your sauce?"" Smiling, she added, ""It's not that hard, and all you need are brightly colored vegetables to make your pasta green, orange, or even purple.""

Many of them completely forgot ever having conducted the search. They gave themselves the credit instead of the Internet. In a different set of studies, researchers found that those who had searched the Internet to answer specific questions rated their ability to answer unrelated questions as higher than those who had not.

That's one reason why for many songwriters 'lyric' seems to be the hardest word. Picture this scene: a songwriter at the piano, or with a guitar, plays with chords and creates an emotion and atmosphere that is creatively inspiring. Our songwriter invents a melody to go with this mood. Then comes the moment where words are required, and that means getting specific. This sad- or happy-sounding chord progression must now direct its general sadness or happiness to a particular human situation. A lyric is the place where the emotional suggestions of pure music are defined as concrete human concerns and events. It's like a piece of translation, from one medium into another. The general musical mood is focused by a lyric into a context, a voice, a human drama."

Moreover, they tend to form spontaneously; when like-minded people find each other, a group emerges. The improvisational collaboration of the entire group translates moments of individual creativity into group innovation. Allowing the space for this self-organizing emergence to occur is difficult for many managers because the outcome isn't controlled by the management team's agenda and is therefore less predictable. Most business executives like to start with the big picture and then work out the details. That's why so many of the best examples of improvised innovation take place outside of formal organizations. In improvisational innovation, teams start with the details and then work up to the big picture.

This genre is dominated, although not exclusively, by football and has produced a number of examples where popular songs become synonymous with the club and are enthusiastically adopted by the fans. More than this they are often spontaneous expressions of loyalty and identity and, according to Desmond Morris, have 'reached the level of something approaching a local art form'. A strong element of the appeal of such sports songs is that they feature 'memorable and easily sung choruses in which fans can participate'. This is a vital part of the team's performance as it makes the fans' presence more tangible. This form of popular culture can be said to display pleasure and emotional excess in contrast to the dominant culture which tends to maintain 'respectable aesthetic distance and control'."

Children reveal and investigate mathematical concepts through their own activities or experiences, such as figuring out how many crackers to take at snack time or sorting shells into piles."

But experts say that digital work didn’t have a negative effect on innovation and creativity. Working within limits pushes us to solve problems. Overall, virtual meeting platforms put more constraints on communication and collaboration than face-to-face settings. For instance, with the press of a button, virtual meeting hosts can control the size of breakout groups and enforce time constraints; only one person can speak at a time; nonverbal signals, particularly those below the shoulders, are diminished; “seating arrangements” are assigned by the platform, not by individuals; and visual access to others may be limited by the size of each participant’s screen. Such restrictions are likely to stretch participants beyond their usual ways of thinking, boosting creativity."

The public now has multiple ways to check facts and learn about differing points of view. In theory, this access should improve our ability to have meaningful discussions with one another and our ability to form informed opinions. But this isn't always the case. One of the most significant developments is that media has become like a Las Vegas buffet ― we have too many choices. When you consider all of the information options ― including niche media and personalized social media networks where developers utilize algorithms to serve up ideal content - there just isn't enough time to explore them all. In this space it is easy to become trapped in an echo chamber, where your own opinions are reinforced by others without introducing new or conflicting content into the mix, which restricts public discourse and can lead to extremes. This is most evident in the realm of politics. Traditionally, mass media has been a place to tune in and hear nonpartisan reporting of facts about a situation or candidate, giving everyone equal access to the vital information necessary to form opinions and make decisions. Cable news networks and partisan online sources can limit the audience's ability to access accurate, full-picture information. In some cases, audience members have made the conscious decision to only engage with content that is in line with their ideals."

A social media program is not merely the fulfillment of a vague need to manage a ""presence"" on popular social networks because ""everyone else is doing it."" ""Being in social media"" serves no purpose in and of itself. In order to serve any purpose at all, a social media presence must either solve a problem for the organization and its customers or result in an improvement of some sort (preferably a measurable one).

These elements of shared practice thus need not presuppose any comparable unity in scientists' beliefs about what they are doing when they use them. Indeed, one role of a paradigm is to enable scientists to work successfully without having to provide a detailed account of what they are doing or what they believe about it.

Reduction or elimination of these factors may require societal action, such as public awareness and public health measures. In many countries, the fact that some environmental hazards are difficult to avoid at the individual level is felt to be more morally egregious than those hazards that can be avoided.

Since cinema was an entirely fantasmatic art, these innovations were completely unnecessary. And what's worse, they could do nothing but turn filmmakers and audiences away from the fantasmatic dimension of cinema, potentially transforming film into a mere delivery device for representations of reality. As long as the irrealism of the silent black and white film predominated, one could not take filmic fantasies for representations of reality.

One is the view that scientific explanation consists in the unification of broad bodies of phenomena under a minimal number of generalizations. According to this view, the (or perhaps, a) goal of science is to construct an economical framework of laws or generalizations that are capable of subsuming all observable phenomena. Scientific explanations organize and systematize our knowledge of the empirical world; the more economical the systematization, the deeper our understanding of what is explained. The other view is the causal/mechanical approach. According to it, a scientific explanation of a phenomenon consists of uncovering the mechanisms that produced the phenomenon of interest. This view sees the explanation of individual events as primary, with the explanation of generalizations flowing from them. That is, the explanation of scientific generalizations comes from the causal mechanisms that produce the regularities."

Imagine trying to shop in a supermarket where the food was arranged in random order on the shelves: tomato soup next to the white bread in one aisle, chicken soup in the back next to the 60-watt light bulbs, one brand of cream cheese in front and another in aisle 8 near the cookies. The task of finding what you want would be time-consuming and extremely difficult, if not impossible. In the case of a supermarket, someone had to design the system of classification. But there is also a ready-made system of classification embodied in our language. The word ""dog,"" for example, groups together a certain class of animals and distinguishes them from other animals. Such a grouping may seem too obvious to be called a classification, but this is only because you have already mastered the word. As a child learning to speak, you had to work hard to learn the system of classification your parents were trying to teach you. Before you got the hang of it, you probably made mistakes, like calling the cat a dog. If you hadn't learned to speak, the whole world would seem like the unorganized supermarket; you would be in the position of an infant, for whom every object is new and unfamiliar. In learning the principles of classification, therefore, we'll be learning about the structure that lies at the core of our language."

Close by, her friend Jane was assisting Anna. Jane noticed that Anna was glancing at the entrance door of the gym. She seemed to be expecting someone. At last, when Anna took a break, Jane came over to her and asked, ""Hey, are you waiting for Cora?"" Anna answered the question by nodding uneasily. In fact, Jane knew what her friend was thinking. Cora was a new member, whom Anna had personally invited to join the club. Anna really liked her. Although her budget was tight, Anna bought Cora a taekwondo uniform. When she received it, Cora thanked her and promised, ""I'll come to practice and work hard every day."" However, unexpectedly, she came to practice only once and then never showed up again. Since Cora had missed several practices, Anna wondered what could have happened. Jane, on the other hand, was disappointed and said judgingly, ""Still waiting for her, huh? I can't believe you don't feel disappointed or angry. Why don't you forget about her?"" Anna replied, ""Well, I know most newcomers don't keep their commitment to the club, but I thought that Cora would be different. She said she would come every day and practice."" Just as Jane was about to respond to her, the door swung open. There she was! Cora walked in like a wounded soldier with bandages on her face and arms. Surprised, Anna and Jane simply looked at her with their eyes wide open. Cora explained, ""I'm sorry I've been absent. I got into a bicycle accident, and I was in the hospital for two days. Finally, the doctor gave me the okay to practice."" Anna said excitedly, ""No problem! We're thrilled to have you back!""

With this form of agency comes the belief that individual successes depend primarily on one's own abilities and actions, and thus, whether by influencing the environment or trying to accept one's circumstances, the use of control ultimately centers on the individual. The independent self may be more driven to cope by appealing to a sense of agency or control. However, people from more interdependent cultural contexts tend to be less focused on issues of individual success and agency and more motivated towards group goals and harmony. Research has shown that East Asians prefer to receive, but not seek, more social support rather than seek personal control in certain cases. Therefore, people who hold a more interdependent self-construal may prefer to cope in a way that promotes harmony in relationships."

The greatest music, even if it’s tragic in nature, takes us to a world higher than ours; somehow the beauty uplifts us. Bad music, on the other hand, degrades us. It’s the same with performances: a bad performance isn’t necessarily the result of incompetence. Some of the worst performances occur when the performers, no matter how accomplished, are thinking more of themselves than of the music they’re playing. These doubtful characters aren’t really listening to what the composer is saying — they’re just showing off, hoping that they’ll have a great ‘success’ with the public. The performer’s basic task is to try to understand the meaning of the music, and then to communicate it honestly to others."

Scientists, de Waal points out, can be some of the worst offenders — employing technical language to distance the other animals from us. They call “kissing” in chimps “mouth-to-mouth contact”; they call “friends” between primates “favorite affiliation partners”; they interpret evidence showing that crows and chimps can make tools as being somehow qualitatively different from the kind of toolmaking said to define humanity. If an animal can beat us at a cognitive task — like how certain bird species can remember the precise locations of thousands of seeds — they write it off as instinct, not intelligence. This and so many more tricks of language are what de Waal has termed “linguistic castration.” The way we use our tongues to disempower animals, the way we invent words to maintain our spot at the top."

Stressful events sometimes force people to develop new skills, reevaluate priorities, learn new insights, and acquire new strengths. In other words, the adaptation process initiated by stress can lead to personal changes for the better. One study that measured participants' exposure to thirty-seven major negative events found a curvilinear relationship between lifetime adversity and mental health. High levels of adversity predicted poor mental health, as expected, but people who had faced intermediate levels of adversity were healthier than those who experienced little adversity, suggesting that moderate amounts of stress can foster resilience. A follow-up study found a similar link between the amount of lifetime adversity and subjects' responses to laboratory stressors. Intermediate levels of adversity were predictive of the greatest resilience. Thus, having to deal with a moderate amount of stress may build resilience in the face of future stress."

Concerns of the present tend to seem larger than potentially greater concerns that lie farther away. Some decisions by their nature present great complexity, whose many variables must come together a certain way for the leader to succeed. Compounding the difficulty, now more than ever, is what ergonomists call information overload, where a leader is overrun with inputs ― via e-mails, meetings, and phone calls ― that only distract and confuse her thinking. Alternatively, the leader's information might be only fragmentary, which might cause her to fill in the gaps with assumptions ― sometimes without recognizing them as such. And the merits of a leader's most important decisions, by their nature, typically are not clear-cut. Instead those decisions involve a process of assigning weights to competing interests, and then determining, based upon some criterion, which one predominates. The result is one of judgment, of shades of gray; like saying that Beethoven is a better composer than Brahms."

Similarly, along with stiffness, a ball needs to bounce properly. A solid rubber ball would be too bouncy for most sports, and a solid ball made of clay would not bounce at all."

You would write, “28 + 14 = 42.” Chemistry is the same way. Chemists have to write chemical equations all the time, and it would take too long to write and read if they had to spell everything out. So chemists use symbols, just like we do in math. A chemical formula lists all the elements that form each molecule and uses a small number to the bottom right of an element’s symbol to stand for the number of atoms of that element. For example, the chemical formula for water is H₂O. That tells us that a water molecule is made up of two hydrogen (“H” and “2”) atoms and one oxygen (“O”) atom."

Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, winning a championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make some earthshaking improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn't particularly notable, but it can be far more meaningful in the long run. The difference this tiny improvement can make over time is surprising. Here's how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you'll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor failure adds up to something much more."

But when we try something new in our adult lives we'll usually make just one attempt before judging whether it's worked. If we don't succeed the first time, or if it feels a little awkward, we'll tell ourselves it wasn't a success rather than giving it another shot. That's a shame, because repetition is central to the process of rewiring our brains. Consider the idea that your brain has a network of neurons. They will connect with each other whenever you remember to use a brain-friendly feedback technique. Those connections aren't very reliable at first, which may make your first efforts a little hit-and-miss. You might remember one of the steps involved, and not the others. But scientists have a saying: ""neurons that fire together, wire together."" In other words, repetition of an action strengthens the connections between the neurons involved in that action. That means the more times you try using that new feedback technique, the more easily it will come to you when you need it."

Paying attention to the nonverbal messages you send can make a significant difference in your relationship with students. In general, most students are often closely tuned in to their teacher's body language. For example, when your students first enter the classroom, their initial action is to look for their teacher. Think about how encouraging and empowering it is for a student when that teacher has a friendly greeting and a welcoming smile. Smiling at students ― to let them know that you are glad to see them ― does not require a great deal of time or effort, but it can make a significant difference in the classroom climate right from the start of class."

Here's what they learned: when a cell phone was present in the room, the participants reported the quality of their relationship was worse than those who'd talked in a cell phone-free room. The pairs who talked in the rooms with cell phones thought their partners showed less empathy. Think of all the times you've sat down to have lunch with a friend and set your phone on the table.

I often check in at a hotel I've visited frequently, only for the people at the front desk to give no indication that they recognize me as a customer. The hotel must have stored a record of my visits, but they don't make that information accessible to the front desk clerks.

What this means is that you can actually train your brain to become more grateful, relaxed, or confident, by repeating experiences that evoke gratitude, relaxation, or confidence. Your brain is shaped by the thoughts you repeat. The more neurons fire as they are activated by repeated thoughts and activities, the faster they develop into neural pathways, which cause lasting changes in the brain.

Increasing control over one's life choices became not only possible but desired. Identity then became a problem. It was no longer almost ready-made at birth but something to be discovered.

When she was eleven, she was told that the Wright brothers had flown their first plane. Since that moment, she dreamed about the day she would soar through the sky. At the age of 23, Coleman moved to Chicago, where she worked at a restaurant to save money for flying lessons. However, she had to travel to Paris to take flying lessons because American flight schools at the time admitted neither women nor Black people. In 1921, she finally became the first Black woman to earn an international pilot's license. She also studied flying acrobatics in Europe and made her first appearance in an airshow in New York in 1922. As a female pioneer of flight, she inspired the next generation to pursue their dreams of flying."

Fertilizing crops with nitrogen and potassium has led to declines in magnesium, zinc, iron and iodine. For example, there has been on average about a 30% decline in the magnesium content of wheat. This is partly due to potassium being a blocker against magnesium absorption by plants. Lower magnesium levels in soil also occur with acidic soils and around 70% of the farmland on earth is now acidic. Thus, the overall characteristics of soil determine the accumulation of minerals in plants. Indeed, nowadays our soil is less healthy and so are the plants grown on it."

Sometimes, you must inform those close to you of upcoming change by conveying important information well in advance. There's a huge difference between saying, ""From now on, we will do things differently,"" which doesn't give people enough time to understand and accept the change, and saying something like, ""Starting next month, we're going to approach things differently."" Telegraphing empowers people to adapt. Telegraphing involves the art of seeing an upcoming event or circumstance and giving others enough time to process and accept the change. Telegraph anything that will take people out of what is familiar and comfortable to them. This will allow processing time for them to accept the circumstances and make the most of what's happening."

For babies, this means that they appear to pay close attention to the patterns that repeat in language. They remember, in a systematic way, how often sounds occur, in what order, with what intervals, and with what changes of pitch. This memory store allows them to track, within the neural circuits of their brains, the frequency of sound patterns and to use this knowledge to make predictions about the meaning in patterns of sounds."

Depending on when they were written and by whom, literary works may contain large amounts of direct telling and lesser amounts of suggestion and implication. But whatever the proportion of a work's showing to telling, there is always something for readers to interpret. Thus we ask the question ""What does the text suggest?"" as a way to approach literary interpretation, as a way to begin thinking about a text's implications. What a text implies is often of great interest to us. And our work of figuring out a text's implications tests our analytical powers.

While there are many possible evolutionary theories for the survival value of bioluminescence, one of the most fascinating is to create a cloak of invisibility. The color of almost all bioluminescent molecules is blue-green, the same color as the ocean above. By self-glowing blue-green, the creatures no longer cast a shadow or create a silhouette, especially when viewed from below against the brighter waters above. Rather, by glowing themselves, they can blend into the sparkles, reflections, and scattered blue-green glow of sunlight or moonlight.

There is only so much space available on a shelf. In addition to greater variety, online bookstores were also able to offer aggressive discounts thanks to their lower operating costs. The combination of lower prices and greater selection led to the slow, steady rise of online bookstores.

This is because this animal spends a lot of its time with its head bent down to eat a low‐nutrient food: grass. While the animal is busy grazing, there will be predators out stalking for their food, so the antelope needs the greatest possible range of vision so that it has the maximum chance of seeing its predator and making an escape. With the eye sockets at the back of the head and on the side, it can see nearly 360° around itself. The eye of the antelope is also at the back of its head, giving it a long nose. If the eyes were at the front of the skull, vision would be obscured by long grass, so its long nose also gives an evolutionary advantage."

In particular, the human body is fantastically complex, and some scientific answers can never be provided in black-or-white terms. All this is why the media tends to oversimplify scientific research when presenting it to the public. In their eyes, they're just ""giving people what they want"" as opposed to offering more accurate but complex information that very few people will read or understand. A perfect example of this is how people want definitive answers as to which foods are ""good"" and ""bad."" Scientifically speaking, there are no ""good"" and ""bad"" foods; rather, food quality exists on a continuum, meaning that some foods are better than others when it comes to general health and well-being."

It is a romantic, not to say idyllic, notion, but deeply misleading because it supposes a static condition. Ecosystems are dynamic, and although some may endure, apparently unchanged, for periods that are long in comparison with the human lifespan, they must and do change eventually.

She was interested in acting from an early age. When she was 17, she attended the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her debut on the stage but was more interested in working in films. In the early 1940s, she gained star status in Hollywood, playing many roles as the heroine of the film. Bergman was considered to have tremendous acting talent, an angelic natural beauty and the willingness to work hard to get the best out of films.

When sunlight illuminates an object from above, the object will be brightest on top. The color of the object will gradually shade darker toward the bottom. This shading gives the object depth and allows the viewer to distinguish its shape. Thus even if an animal is exactly, but uniformly, the same color as the substrate, it will be easily visible when illuminated. Most animals, however, are darker above than they are below. When they are illuminated from above, the darker back is lightened and the lighter belly is shaded. The animal thus appears to be a single color and easily blends in with the substrate. This pattern of coloration, or countershading, destroys the visual impression of shape in the organism. It allows the animal to blend in with its background."

Ford considered the camera to be a window and the audience to be outside the window viewing the people and events within. We are asked to watch the actions as if they were taking place at a distance, and we are not asked to participate. The objective point of view employs a static camera as much as possible in order to produce this window effect, and it concentrates on the actors and the action without drawing attention to the camera. The objective camera suggests an emotional distance between camera and subject; the camera seems simply to be recording, as straightforwardly as possible, the characters and actions of the story. For the most part, the director uses natural, normal types of camera positioning and camera angles. The objective camera does not comment on or interpret the action but merely records it, letting it unfold. We see the action from the viewpoint of an impersonal observer. If the camera moves, it does so unnoticeably, calling as little attention to itself as possible."

If students are exposed to new experiences via demonstrations or through the unexpected enthusiasm of their teachers or peers, they will be much more likely to connect with the information that follows. Willis has written that encouraging active discovery in the classroom allows students to interact with new information, moving it beyond working memory to be processed in the frontal lobe, which is devoted to advanced cognitive functioning.

Such taxes express society's disapproval of these activities by raising the cost of engaging in them. Proposals to tax sugary sodas (to combat obesity) or carbon emissions (to address climate change) likewise seek to change norms and shape behavior. Not all taxes have this aim.

At first glance, this seemed to imply that being a medical school class president is bad for you. Does this mean that you should avoid being medical school class president at all costs? Probably not. Just because being class president is correlated with shorter life expectancy does not mean that it causes shorter life expectancy. In fact, it seems likely that the sort of person who becomes medical school class president is, on average, extremely hard-working, serious, and ambitious. Perhaps this extra stress, and the corresponding lack of social and relaxation time ― rather than being class president per se ― contributes to lower life expectancy.

Then they were offered the choice of either a fruit salad or a chocolate cake. When the number the students memorized was seven digits long, 63% of them chose the cake. When the number they were asked to remember had just two digits, however, 59% opted for the fruit salad. Our reflective brains know that the fruit salad is better for our health, but our reflexive brains desire that soft, fattening chocolate cake. If the reflective brain is busy figuring something else out - like trying to remember a seven-digit number - then impulse can easily win. On the other hand, if we're not thinking too hard about something else (with only a minor distraction like memorizing two digits), then the reflective system can deny the emotional impulse of the reflexive side."

He was so happy, he sang all day long. The children loved to stand around his window to listen to him. Next door to the shoemaker lived a rich man. He used to sit up all night to count his gold. In the morning, he went to bed, but he could not sleep because of the sound of the shoemaker's singing. One day, he thought of a way of stopping the singing. He wrote a letter to the shoemaker asking him to visit. The shoemaker came at once, and to his surprise the rich man gave him a bag of gold. When he got home again, the shoemaker opened the bag. He had never seen so much gold before! When he sat down at his bench and began, carefully, to count it, the children watched through the window. There was so much there that the shoemaker was afraid to let it out of his sight. So he took it to bed with him. But he could not sleep for worrying about it. Very early in the morning, he got up and brought his gold down from the bedroom. He had decided to hide it up the chimney instead. But he was still uneasy, and in a little while he dug a hole in the garden and buried his bag of gold in it. It was no use trying to work. He was too worried about the safety of his gold. And as for singing, he was too miserable to utter a note. He could not sleep, or work, or sing ― and, worst of all, the children no longer came to see him. At last, the shoemaker felt so unhappy that he seized his bag of gold and ran next door to the rich man. ""Please take back your gold,"" he said. ""The worry of it is making me ill, and I have lost all of my friends. I would rather be a poor shoemaker, as I was before."" And so the shoemaker was happy again and sang all day at his work."

When that happens, the news media often don't go back and inform their audiences about the change ― assuming they even hear about it. Kelly Crowe, a CBC News reporter writes, quoting one epidemiologist, ""There is increasing concern that in modern research, false findings may be the majority or even the vast majority of published research claims."" She goes on to suggest that journalists, though blameworthy for this tendency, are aided and abetted by the scientists whose studies they cite. She writes that the ""conclusions"" sections in scientific abstracts can sometimes be overstated in an attempt to draw attention from prestigious academic journals and media who uncritically take their bait. Even so, Crowe ends her piece by stressing that there is still an incompatibility between the purposes and processes of news and science: Science 'evolves,' but news 'happens.'"

The art of this period reflected the disruption caused by this shift. Appropriately named the Baroque, meaning irregular or distorted, European painting in the 16th century largely focused on capturing motion, drama, action, and powerful emotion. Painters employed the strong visual tools of dramatic composition, intense contrast of light and dark, and emotionally provocative subject matter to stir up feelings of disruption. Religious subjects were often portrayed in this era through new dramatic visual language, a contrast to the reverential portrayal of religious figures in earlier traditions. In order to capture the social disruption surrounding Christianity and the Roman Catholic Church, many artists abandoned old standards of visual perfection from the Classical and Renaissance periods in their portrayal of religious figures."

Under a statist social system, taxes, subsidies, tariffs, and regulations often serve to protect existing large players in the marketplace. Those players often use crony tactics to retain or expand the protections: a new tariff preventing foreign competition, a subsidy making it harder for new players to compete with them, or a regulatory measure that a large company has the resources to comply with. Under a capitalist social system, on the other hand, the government has no say in how dominant a company may become in its industry or how companies take over and merge with one another. Furthermore, a capitalist society doesn't have rights-violating taxes, tariffs, subsidies, or regulations favoring anybody nor does it have antitrust laws. Under capitalism, dominance can only be achieved by becoming really good at what you're doing. And to maintain dominance, you have to continue to stay ahead of the competition, which sees your dominance and profits as a sign that there is money to be made by others as well."

This strategy involves abandoning the old notions of acquiring new customers and increasing transactions to focus instead on more fully serving the needs of existing customers. Financial services are a great example of this. Most consumers purchase financial services from different firms. They bank at one institution, purchase insurance from another, and handle their investments elsewhere. To counter this purchasing pattern, many companies now offer all of these services under one roof. For example, Regions Financial Corporation offers retail and commercial banking, trust, mortgage, and insurance products to customers in a network of more than 1,500 offices. The company tries to more fully serve the financial needs of its current customers, thereby acquiring a larger share of each customer's financial business. By creating these types of relationships, customers have little incentive to seek out competitive firms to fulfill their financial services needs."

When the supercontinent Pangea fragmented, it was torn apart along rifts that just so happened to leave Eurasia as a broad landmass running in an east-west direction ― the entire continent stretches more than a third of the way around the world, but mostly within a relatively narrow range of latitudes. As it is the latitude on the Earth that largely determines the climate and length of the growing season, crops domesticated in one part of Eurasia can be transplanted across the continent with only minimal need for adaptation to the new locale. Thus wheat cultivation spread readily from the uplands of Turkey throughout Mesopotamia, to Europe, and all the way round to India, for example. The twin continents of the Americas, by contrast, lie in a north-south direction. Here, the spreading of crops originally domesticated in one region to another led to a much harder process of re-adapting the plant species to different growing conditions."

For example, genes determine what parts of the neocortex are connected to the eyes, what other parts are connected to the ears, and how those parts connect to each other. Therefore, we can say that the neocortex is structured at birth to see, hear, and even learn language. But it is also true that the neocortex doesn't know what it will see, what it will hear, and what specific languages it might learn.

This unprecedented ability to measure time precisely found its most authoritarian expression in the factory clock, which became a prime weapon of the Industrial Revolution. As the historian of technology Lewis Mumford argued, ""the clock, not the steam engine, is the key-machine of the modern industrial age."" Soon factory workers were clocking in, filling out timesheets, and being punished for lateness. With time sliced into smaller and smaller periods, business owners could measure the speed of their workers down to the second, and gradually increase the pace of the production line. Workers who tried to reject this strict control by ""going slow"" were swiftly fired. The cruel power of the clock fed the growing culture of utilitarian efficiency, so brilliantly depicted by Charles Dickens in his 1854 novel Hard Times, where the office of Mr. Gradgrind contained ""a deadly statistical clock in it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin-lid."""

This is unambiguously disadvantageous ― but only very slightly so. More than 99 percent of animals carrying this mutation will never experience its ill effects because they will die before it has a chance to act. This means that it's pretty likely to remain in the population ― not because it's good, but because the 'force of natural selection' at such advanced ages is not strong enough to get rid of it. Conversely, if a mutation killed the animals at two years, striking them down when many could reasonably expect to still be alive and producing children, evolution would get rid of it very promptly: animals with the mutation would soon be outcompeted by those fortunate enough not to have it, because the force of natural selection is powerful in the years up to and including reproductive age.

If this question can be answered, a new city model can be proposed based on the concept. Here, we focus on productivity and diversity as characteristics of cities. This is because ensuring productivity and diversity is the driving force for sustainability. For example, if there is a place to work, people gather and work there, and the population gradually accumulates to form a city. However, the industrial structure that depends on a single industry is vulnerable to social changes. Given that gold mining cities and coal mining cities have risen and fallen, their vulnerability is obvious. A city where various people gather in various industries is secure against social changes. The same is true in the natural world, and the importance of biodiversity is essential for the sustainability of the species. The same is true in cities. In a society where people of all ages and income levels live together, and diverse industries coexist while depending on each other, cities will continue to exist overcoming environmental changes such as population decline."

During these periods children and adults alike would go to bed hungry some days and everyone would lose fat and muscle. But over longer periods of time farming societies were far more likely to suffer severe, existentially threatening famines than foragers. Foraging may be much less productive and generate far lower energy yields than farming but it is also much less risky. This is firstly because foragers tended to live well within the natural limits imposed by their environments, and secondly because where farmers typically relied on one or two staple crops, foragers in even the harshest environments relied on dozens of different food sources and so were usually able to adjust their diets to align with an ecosystem's own dynamic responses to changing conditions.

Since the twentieth century, Western societies have defined themselves as knowledge societies, where knowledge is essential for social organization and productivity. At the same time, the lack of knowledge proved to be important for stabilizing political and social order. For instance, secrets were essential to creating legitimacy in the early modern period, when individuals believed the world was created and ruled by divine power. By concealing the circumstances of their decisions, rulers cultivated a special aura that set them apart from ordinary people and made them seem more like unknowable gods.

For instance, Earth's crust contains an average of about 55 ppm (parts per million) of copper, whereas copper ore deposits must contain about 5,000 ppm (0.5%) copper before we can mine them. Thus, geologic processes need to concentrate the average copper content of the crust by about 100 times to make a copper ore deposit that we can use. We then use industrial processes to convert copper ore into pure copper metal, an increase of about 200 times. By a fortunate coincidence, elements and materials that we use in large amounts need less natural concentration than those that we use in small amounts. Thus, we are likely to have larger deposits of mineral commodities that we use in large amounts. As long as energy costs remain high, the relation between work that we can afford to do and work that we expect nature to do will control the lower limit of natural concentrations that we can exploit, and this puts very real limits on our global mineral resources."

With this in mind, he researched the way people spontaneously touch their faces. We all do it. You might be doing it right now while reading this. These movements are not for communication and, in most cases, we are not even aware of them. But that does not mean they serve no purpose, as Grunwald discovered. He measured the brain activity of test subjects while they tried to remember a sequence of haptic stimuli for five minutes. When he disturbed them with unpleasant noises, the subjects dramatically increased the rate at which they touched their faces. When the noises upset the rhythm of their brains and threatened to disrupt the subjects' concentration, self-touch helped them get their concentration back on track. To put it another way: self-touch grounded their minds."

One day, he accidentally broke his right arm and went into a restaurant, asking for a free meal. The owner of the restaurant felt pity for his injury and offered him a free meal. The next day, James came back again and asked him for another free meal. Instead of giving James a free meal, the owner of the restaurant took a few seconds to think and pointed at a pile of bricks in front of the door. Then he said to James, ""Please help me move this pile of bricks to the back of the restaurant."" James said, ""How can I move those bricks with only one hand?"" Without replying, the owner bent over to lift a brick and intentionally moved it with only one hand. ""You don't actually have to use two hands to work,"" said the owner. James looked at the owner of the restaurant suspiciously. But moments later, James started moving bricks with his left hand. It took him two hours to move all the bricks. After that, the owner offered him a meal. James felt that the meal tasted much better than the one he had before. When he finished his meal, the owner handed him $50. He took the money and said gratefully, ""Thank you."" The owner said, ""You don't have to thank me. You earned that money with your own strength."" James bowed deeply and set off.

There are plenty of other situations in which, in the short term, it may be more comfortable not to tell the truth to followers. Ultimately, however, even dishonesty that was meant to protect employee morale will eventually be exposed, undermining trustworthiness at a time when commitment to the organization is most vital.

The researcher takes the responses from a sample group and calculates the mean to plot on the spider chart.

These could be anything from genome-specific medicines to personalized care or tailored suits. That is different from more and more stuff, an arms race of growth.

Could an infant tell the difference between two similar images? Between two similar shades of the same color? Could an infant recall having seen something an hour, a day, a week ago? The inbuilt attraction to novel images held the answer. If the infant's gaze lingered, it suggested that the infant could tell that a similar image was nonetheless different in some way. If the infant, after a week without seeing an image, didn't look at it much when it was shown again, the infant must be able at some level to remember having seen it the week before. In most cases, the results revealed that infants were more cognitively capable earlier than had been previously assumed.

The ready‑to‑wear sector was established much earlier in America than in Britain and with it came new challenges. Previously garments were custom‑made by skilled individuals who later became known as or recognized as being fashion designers. These handmade garments that are now accepted as being the fashion garments of that time were only made for those with the means to pay for them. The lesser‑privileged mass market wore homemade and handed down garments. Later, by the end of the industrial revolution, fashion was more readily available and affordable to all classes. By now designers worked predominately within factories and no longer designed for individuals but for mass markets. Thus the direct communication link between the designer and client no longer existed and designers had to rely on anticipating the needs and desires of the new fashion consumer."

Ongoing research by Kleitman and Aserinsky concluded that it was during this period of rapid eye movement that people dream, yet their minds are as active as someone who is awake. Interestingly enough, studies have found that along with rapid eye movement, our heart rates increase and our respiration is also elevated ─ yet our bodies do not move and are basically paralyzed due to a nerve center in the brain that keeps our bodies motionless besides some occasional twitches and jerks. This is why it is difficult to wake up from or scream out during a nightmare. To sum it up, during the REM dream state, your mind is busy but your body is at rest."

A study in America found that people overestimated the number of calories they burned in a workout by a factor of four. They also then consumed, on average, about twice as many calories as they had just burned off. As Daniel Lieberman noted in The Story of the Human Body, a worker on a factory floor will in a year expend about 175,000 more calories than a desk worker — equivalent to more than sixty marathons. That’s pretty impressive, but here’s a reasonable question: how many factory workers look as if they run a marathon every six days? To be cruelly blunt, not many.

Every so often, though, these same posts are called upon to do something crucial but fundamentally at odds with their everyday function: they need to break easily on impact. If hit by a fast-moving vehicle, posts need to come apart in just the right way in order to reduce damage and save lives. Engineers have spent a lot of time attempting to resolve this apparent paradox. One of the ways to get robust posts to break properly is called a ""slip base"" system. Instead of using a single continuous post, a slip base approach joins two separate posts close to ground level using a connector plate. This joint allows the pair to break apart at an intended juncture. It works basically like this: a lower post is put in the ground, then an upper post is attached to it using breakaway bolts. These bolts are made to fracture or dislodge when the post gets hit hard enough, so the upper post gets knocked over while the lower post passes safely under the moving vehicle. When everything works as designed, such posts can also help slow down a vehicle and minimize damage. Subsequent infrastructure repair becomes easier as well ─ in many cases, a new upper post can simply be bolted onto the undamaged base post below it, which requires less material and work.

""Did you see those ducks?"" my husband asked. To which I replied, ""Ducks? They were chickens!"" ""No, honey, I am talking about the mama duck with the three ducklings!"" ""You mean the mama hen and the three chicks?"" He retorted, ""Honey, they were waddling with orange beaks!"" ""Oh, come on,"" I said doubtfully. ""They had yellow beaks with red crests."" Believe it or not, this conversation continued for the next three miles and deteriorated to the point that I shouted, ""I know the difference between a duck and a chicken!"" ""Then I am turning this car around because I can't believe you think you saw chickens!"" ""Good! Because I can't believe you think they were ducks,"" I answered quickly. As we reached the top of the hill, the farmhouse came into view, and I quickly pointed up the hill to the yard of the farmhouse. ""See, those are chickens!"" At the same time, my husband was pointing to the roadside gully, saying, ""See, those are ducks!"" We could not believe our eyes! Indeed, in the same yard, a mama duck and three ducklings were playing in the water by the side of the road and, up near the farmhouse, there was a mama hen pecking the ground with her three baby chicks following suit. We immediately broke into uncontrollable laughter and pulled to the side of the road to gain our composure. Understandably, my husband's perspective had been restricted to the road ahead while driving. My own perspective had narrowed to the sides of the road as I enjoyed the views of the horizon. Not every disagreement is as easy to solve as our ducks‑and‑chickens experience. But to this day, my husband and I end many conflicts by agreeing to disagree. I'll say, ""It's a chicken,"" to which he will reply, ""It's a duck."" Each of us is willing to compromise as we consider the different perspectives of the other and realize that both of us can be right. We even have a wooden chicken and duck displayed in our living room as a constant reminder of that day and to not take ourselves too seriously!"

A consumer culture isn’t a saving culture, isn’t a thrift culture. It’s too fixated on buying the next toy to ever delay gratification, to ever save and invest for the future. The point is elementary: you can’t have sustainable capitalism without capital; you can’t have capital without savings; and you can’t save if you’re running around spending everything you’ve just earned. But the confusion has grown so deep that many people today do not have the ears to hear it. Indeed, the policies of our nation’s central bank seem to reinforce this habit by driving down interest rates to near zero and thereby denying people a material reward — in the form of interest on their banked savings — for foregoing consumption."

Even so, he didn’t find much success until he came back to the United States in 1795, when he painted a portrait of George Washington. Stuart is called the “father of American portraiture” because he painted pictures of all the famous people of early America. One of his paintings of George Washington was hung in the White House. The image of Washington on the U.S. one-dollar bill came from one of Stuart’s most famous paintings of Washington. In 1824, Stuart suffered a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, but he still continued to paint for two years until his death on July 9, 1828."

It was not long before musicians began to wonder whether recordings of popular artists or songs would undermine the demand for live music. For a time, however, recorded music was too scratchy to pose a serious threat, even though it played in commercial places and offered a few performers a way to supplement their income. Additionally, during the early days of recording, radio stations preferred using live musicians on their programs. Sound from live performances was better quality, and stations at this time rarely used recordings. Broadcasters satisfied union demands for employment and decent wages, because the alterative use of recordings was even less attractive. They made efforts to employ orchestras, bands, and vocalists to perform on radio programs. There was relative balance between live music and technology in the early innovation stages. With increased improvements in electrical recording, however, this balance soon changed."

The mining of lead and cadmium are examples of this. Petroleum is also a substance that has been dug out of the bowels of the earth and introduced into the surface ecology by man.

People just ""knew"" that's how horses galloped, and that is how they ""saw"" them galloping. Cavemen saw them this way, Aristotle saw them this way, and so did Victorian gentry. But all of that ended when, in 1878, Eadweard Muybridge published a set of twelve pictures he had taken of a galloping horse in the space of less than half a second using twelve cameras hooked to wire triggers. Muybridge's photos showed clearly that a horse goes completely airborne in the third step of the gallop with its legs collected beneath it, not splayed. It is called the moment of suspension. Now even kids draw horses galloping this way."

People often repress their awareness of the future because thinking about it distorts the comfort of the now, which tends to be more powerful than the future because it is present and because it is certain. The future, on the other hand, must be imagined in advance and, for that very reason, is always uncertain. Getting along with the future is not an easy task, nor is it one in which instinct prevents us from blunders.

That environment can be a nature preserve many miles from our home, or a computer-simulated Mars, or any other space that our ego doesn't associate directly with our health, social status, and material success. In that environment, our ego will be less inclined to take the failure of its predictions personally. Certainly, our ego may feel a little upset that its guesses about the nature preserve or Mars were wrong, but it was never really that invested in the guesses to begin with. Why should it care too much about things that have no bearing on its own fame or well-being?

As water molecules rise high up in the atmosphere, they may split up into their constituent chemical elements, hydrogen and oxygen, under the influence of sunlight. Whereas the much heavier oxygen either remains in the atmosphere or is captured on the Earth's surface, the hydrogen tends to escape into space, because it is so light that Earth's gravity cannot retain it. As long as there was little or no free oxygen in the atmosphere that could capture hydrogen before it escaped into the cosmos, this process would have continued unhindered. However, after all the available materials on the Earth's surface, mostly iron, had combined with the free oxygen, it began to appear in the atmosphere in sizable quantities. As soon as this happened, the free oxygen would have captured most of the free hydrogen by forming water molecules again, thus slowing down the loss of hydrogen. Over the course of time, this process would have helped to retain water on Earth, while it also contributed to the emergence of oxygen in the atmosphere."

Likewise, the chemical structure of proteins and DNA may be read to reveal relationships among now strikingly different organisms.

The bottom line is that we humans are easily bored. But why should this be true? The answer lies buried deep in our nerve cells, which are designed to reduce their initial excited response to stimuli each time they occur. At the same time, these neurons enhance their responses to things that change ― especially things that change quickly. We probably evolved this way because our ancestors got more survival value, for example, from attending to what was moving in a tree (such as a puma) than to the tree itself. Boredom in reaction to an unchanging environment turns down the level of neural excitation so that new stimuli (like our ancestor’s hypothetical puma threat) stand out more.

As such, they structure and coordinate our perceptual input by arranging and prioritizing relevant information. As selective constraints on input, emotions initially focus our attention on subjects important to our goals, wants, and interests. Then, reinforced by physiological changes, they move us towards action. Despite the habitual discursive distinction between intellect and affect, therefore, emotions can be considered rational in a narrower sense, since they constitute an effective response in a given set of circumstances by supplying information about reasonable action. Claiming that emotions are vital for intelligent action means adopting what Dylan Evans calls 'the positive view of emotion'. Findings from evolutionary theory further substantiate the idea that 'the benefits of having emotions outweigh the drawbacks'. The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, who has studied the role of emotion in decision-making and other tasks commonly considered 'purely rational', goes so far as to conclude that, in matters of social and personal importance, good decisions include an emotional component. Consequently, in addition to adopting rational strategies such as cost-benefit analyses, people appear to deliberate, narrow down, and choose from a range of behavioural options through an initial emotional assessment of envisioned outcomes as either beneficial or harmful."

Instead, they simply run the race laid out for them. They do well enough in school to keep advancing. Maybe they manage to get a good job at a well-run company. But so many think and act as if their learning journey ends with college. They have checked all the boxes in the life that was laid out for them and now lack a road map describing the right ways to move forward and continue to grow. In truth, that’s when the journey really begins. When school is finished, your growth becomes voluntary. Like healthy eating habits or a regular exercise program, you need to commit to it and devote thought, time, and energy to it. Otherwise, it simply won’t happen ― and your life and career are likely to stop progressing as a result."

They say a tree’s leaves are green because they reflect green light ― a greenness that is just as real as the leaves. Others argue that color doesn’t inhabit the physical world at all but exists only in the eye or mind of the viewer. They maintain that if a tree fell in a forest and no one was there to see it, its leaves would be colorless ― and so would everything else. They say there is no such thing as color; there are only the people who see it. Both positions are, in a way, correct. Color is objective and subjective ― “the place,” as Paul Cézanne put it, “where our brain and the universe meet.” Color is created when light from the world is registered by the eyes and interpreted by the brain."

In several European countries, there are legal requirements which specify that a whole team of doctors must agree over the diagnosis of death in the case of a potential donor. The reason for these strict regulations for diagnosing brain death in potential organ donors is, no doubt, to ease public fears of a premature diagnosis of brain death for the purpose of obtaining organs. But it is questionable whether these requirements reduce public suspicions as much as they create them. They certainly maintain mistaken beliefs that diagnosing brain death is an unreliable process lacking precision. As a matter of consistency, at least, criteria for diagnosing the deaths of organ donors should be exactly the same as for those for whom immediate burial or cremation is intended."

This insecurity naturally stems from their attachment to their possessions. It is difficult to distance oneself from something that has been around for quite some time. Being an emotional animal, human beings give meaning to the things around them. So, the question arising here is that if minimalism will hurt one's emotions, why become a minimalist? The answer is very simple; the assumption of the question is fundamentally wrong. Minimalism does not hurt emotions. You might feel a bit sad while getting rid of a useless item but sooner than later, this feeling will be overcome by the joy of clarity. Minimalists never argue that you should leave every convenience of the modern era.

In the beginning, this caused him great difficulties: just putting food in his mouth with a fork was a challenge for him. With time, however, his visual system adjusted to the new stimuli from reality, and he was able to act normally in his environment again, even seeing it upright when he concentrated. As he took off his reversing glasses, he was again confronted with problems: he used the wrong hand when he wanted to reach for something, for example.

It's possible to move between many of these perspectives, although we may need some additional tools and skills to zoom in on individual pieces of hair or zoom out to entire ecosystems.

Plato's extraordinary answer was that the world we see is a poor reflection of a deeper unseen reality of Forms, or universals, where perfect cats chase perfect mice in perfect circles around perfect rocks.

It is the area of the brain responsible for preventing you from sending off an initial angry text and modifying it with kinder words. On the other hand, the limbic system matures earlier, playing a central role in processing emotional responses. Because of its earlier development, it is more likely to influence decision-making. Decision-making in the adolescent brain is led by emotional factors more than the perception of consequences. Due to these differences, there is an imbalance between feeling-based decision-making ruled by the more mature limbic system and logical-based decision-making by the not-yet-mature prefrontal cortex.

The factor to consider is that this person may experience changes in the texture of the face, particularly with the appearance of wrinkles and sagging skin. These changes may be highlighted by weight gain or loss. To counteract this problem, researchers have developed models for face aging or digital de-aging.

The biggest loss of crop diversity came in the decades that followed the Second World War. In an attempt to save millions from extreme hunger, crop scientists found ways to produce grains such as rice and wheat on an enormous scale. And thousands of traditional varieties were replaced by a small number of new super-productive ones. The strategy worked spectacularly well, at least to begin with. Because of it, grain production tripled, and between 1970 and 2020 the human population more than doubled. Leaving the contribution of that strategy to one side, the danger of creating more uniform crops is that they are more at risk when it comes to disasters. Specifically, a global food system that depends on just a narrow selection of plants has a greater chance of not being able to survive diseases, pests and climate extremes."

However, these approaches had to be modified to account for the differences between genetic and cultural transmission. For example, we do not expect the cultural transmission to follow the rules of genetic transmission strictly. If two biological parents have different forms of a cultural trait, their child is not necessarily equally likely to acquire the mother’s or father’s form of that trait. Further, a child can acquire cultural traits not only from its parents but also from nonparental adults and peers; thus, the frequency of a cultural trait in the population is relevant beyond just the probability that an individual’s parents had that trait."

Now the path does not represent the working of any particular force; there is simply the combination of the three elementary forces mentioned; but in a real sense, there is something in the total action besides the isolated action of three forces, namely, their joint action. In the same way, when two or more human individuals are together, their mutual relationships and their arrangement into a group are things which would not be revealed if we confined our attention to each individual separately. The significance of group behavior is greatly increased in the case of human beings by the fact that some of the tendencies to action of the individual are related definitely to other persons, and could not be aroused except by other persons acting as stimuli. An individual in complete isolation would not reveal their competitive tendencies, their tendencies towards the opposite sex, their protective tendencies towards children.

This would have been a very difficult thing to explain according to the law of gravitation. If a law does not work even in one place where it ought to, it is just wrong. But the reason for this discrepancy was very simple and beautiful: it takes a little while to see the moons of Jupiter because of the time it takes light to travel from Jupiter to the earth. When Jupiter is closer to the earth the time is a little less, and when it is farther from the earth, the time is more. This is why moons appear to be, on the average, a little ahead or a little behind, depending on whether they are closer to or farther from the earth."

General psychology has shown that knowledge of results is necessary for improving a skill. Advanced musicians are able to self-critique their performances, but developing music students rely on teachers to supply evaluative feedback. The most constructive feedback is that which expresses the discrepancies between a student's performance of a piece of music and an optimal version. Expert teachers give more detailed feedback than general appraisals, and music educators generally recognize that more specific teacher feedback facilitates student performance improvement. Researchers also have explored whether the feedback of effective teachers is more often positively or negatively expressed, that is, constituting praise or criticism. One might intuitively think that positive comments are more motivating to students and, as a result, are more associated with effective teaching. The research, however, paints a slightly different picture. Although positive feedback is likely more helpful with younger learners and in one-on-one instruction, more advanced music students seem to accept and benefit from greater levels of criticism in lessons."

When a hormone is released from a gland, it travels in the bloodstream through the body in search of its target. Organs, tissues and other glands in the body have receptor sites that hormones must bind to in order to deliver their message and cause an effect. But because every hormone has its own unique shape, they are designed to act only on the parts of the body that have a receptor site with the corresponding shape. This mode of action can be likened to a lock and key mechanism ― if the key doesn’t fit the lock, then nothing will happen. When a hormone binds to its receptor, it sets off a chain of other signaling pathways to create a change in the body. Once the desired effect has taken place and there is too much hormone circulating in the blood, this signal is fed back to the glands to suppressfurther hormone release. This is called a feedback loop and, when functioning correctly, it allows the endocrine system to ensure the conditions in your body remain in balance."

That is, to the extent that two people share similar verbal and nonverbal habits in a first meeting, they will be more comfortable with one another. For example, fast-paced individuals talk and move quickly and are more expressive, whereas slow-paced individuals have a different tempo and are less expressive. Initial interactions between people at opposite ends of such a continuum may be more difficult than those between similar types. In the case of contrasting styles, individuals may be less interested in pursuing a relationship than if they were similar in interaction styles. Individuals with similar styles, however, are more comfortable and find that they just seem to ""click"" with one another. Thus, behavioral coordination may provide a selection filter for the initiation of a relationship."

The male bowerbirds of New Guinea and Australia dedicate huge fractions of their time and energy to creating elaborate structures from twigs, flowers, berries, beetle wings, and even colorful trash.

What's most amazing about the towers and ""bowers"" they construct is that they aren't stereotyped like a beehive or hummingbird nest. Each one is different. Artistic skill, along with fine craftsbirdship, is rewarded by the females. Many researchers suggest these displays are used by the females to gauge the cognitive abilities of her potential mates, but Darwin thought that she was actually attracted to their beauty. In other words, the bowers aren't simply signals of mate quality; they are appreciated by the females for their own sake, much as we appreciate a painting or a bouquet of spring flowers. A 2013 study looked at whether bowerbirds that did better on cognitive tests were more successful at attracting mates. They were not, suggesting whatever the females are looking for, it isn't a straightforward indicator of cognitive ability."

The rational is the highway on which everyone travels, and no one is specially marked."" Here, Hegel maintains that individuals can be differentiated from each other in terms of their acts but they are not differentiated with respect to reason. There are specific thoughts, but they are finally resolved into the universal.

It challenges the assumption that language can be precisely used to represent reality.

The use of signs (words) and their meaning can vary depending on the flow of the text in which they are used, leading to the possibility of 'deconstructing' text to reveal its underlying inconsistencies. This approach can be applied to all forms of representation ― pictures, films, etc. that gain added or alternative meanings by the overlaying of references to previous uses. This can be seen particularly in the media, where it is difficult to distinguish the real from the unreal ― everything is representation, there is no reality."

As the fragments joined, the Earth's gravity increased, attracting larger and larger objects to impact the Earth. This increasing gravity, combined with the timeless radioactive decay of elements like uranium and thorium, caused the new Earth to heat up. The internal temperature and pressure were high enough for many compounds to break down or melt, releasing their water and gases.

The word ""animal"" categorizes all non-human animals and distances humans from other animals. Seeing all other animals as one group in contrast to humans reinforces anthropocentrism, which contributes to the legitimization of practices in which other animals are used for human benefit. Jacques Derrida argues that instead of one line between Man on the one side and Animal on the other, there is a multiple and heterogeneous border; beyond the edge of the ""so-called human,"" we find a heterogeneous plurality of the living. To account for this multitude, using the word ""animot"" has been proposed. In speech it refers to the plural, the multiplicity of animals, which is necessary because there is no one ""animal."" The ""mot"" in ""animot"" refers to the act of naming and the risks involved in drawing a distinction between human and animal by the human.

The importance of measurement in this sort of cosmic comprehension did not develop smoothly over the centuries. Indeed, in the Middle Ages in Europe, calculating by hand and eye was sometimes seen as producing a rather shabby sort of knowledge, inferior to that of abstract thought. The suspicion was due to the influence of ancient Greeks in the era's scholasticism, particularly Plato and Aristotle, who stressed that the material world was one of unceasing change and instability. They emphasized that reality was best understood by reference to immaterial qualities, be they Platonic forms or Aristotelian causes.

In the next step, a non-square rectangle was introduced and associated with an even larger reward than the square. As expected, the rats learned to reliably prefer the rectangle. Less predictable was the third part of the experiment. The rats were offered the opportunity to choose between the rectangle they already knew and associated with large rewards and another rectangle, the proportions of which were even more different from those of a square. Interestingly, rats picked this novel variant, without undergoing any reward-based conditioning in favor of it. A possible explanation is thus that they chose the larger difference from the original square (i.e., the exaggeration of non-squareness)."

But this ""social hypothesis"" does not explain why it was the great apes that became so clever, rather than monkeys or a group of terrestrial mammals.

Rather than needing thick, flat plates that can apply large compression forces to grind up tough materials and crush hard ones, it is better to have molars with pointed ends to cut through the softer food. It loosens at much lower forces and breaks up far more quickly. Modern hunter-gatherers spend far less time chewing their food even than apes that eat relatively soft fruit; they chew for less than an hour a day compared with five or six hours for chimpanzees.

The human agent initiated the conceptual form, and a machine actuated it. Likewise, the computer artwork lacked any autographic mark, trace of spontaneity, or artistic authenticity. The plotter arm would replace the human arm in the production process."

Mating, nesting, eating, and prey-killing behaviors tend to be governed more by instinct. The greater dependence on learning to find food makes animals in the wild more flexible and able to adapt to a variety of environments. Behaviors used to kill or consume food can be the same in any environment. Ernst Mayr, an evolutionary biologist, called these different behavioral systems ""open"" or ""closed"" to the effects of experience. A lion hunting her prey is an example of an open system. The hunting female lion recognizes her prey from a distance and approaches it carefully. Charles Herrick, a neurobiologist, wrote, ""the details of the hunt vary every time she hunts. Therefore no combination of simple reflex arcs laid down in the nervous system will be adequate to meet the infinite variations of the requirements for obtaining food."""

Indeed, the new community typically rewrites the textbooks, and retells its own history, to reflect this point of view. But from the standpoint of the losers, or even of those who look on impartially, such rewritings might seem to mark change without any genuine claim to progress, because there is no neutral standard by which to assess the merits of the change. The resulting body of knowledge is in any case not cumulative, since much of what was previously known (or merely believed) had to be excluded without ever having been conclusively refuted. One likewise cannot plausibly talk about revolutionary reconstitutions of science as aiming toward truth, for similarly, there can be no impartial formulation of standards for its assessment. The available justification of scientific knowledge after revolutions, couched in new terms according to newly instituted standards, may well be sufficient, but perhaps only because these standards and terms are now inevitably our own."

However, they do provide information about how a place changed over time, who the major personalities were and the significant events that occurred there; or at least those selected by the author for inclusion.

The harmful effects of animals on tourism experiences has been the subject of analysis in a small number of studies, but deaths or injuries caused by animals to tourists are tiny in comparison to other causes such as drowning and vehicular accidents. Nevertheless, the possibility that they might encounter a dangerous animal such as shark or snake or catch a disease such as malaria is sufficient to stop at least some tourists from visiting destinations where such threats exist. Sometimes this fear is turned into a marketing opportunity. For example, there are a variety of t-shirt and tea towel designs which celebrate the dangerous animals that can be encountered in Australia. This is a whimsical reconfiguration of the perceived threat that these animals pose to some tourists considering travel to this country."

The precise linguistic input children receive differs from child to child; no two children are exposed to exactly the same set of utterances. Yet, they all arrive at pretty much the same grammar. The input that children get is haphazard in the sense that caretakers do not talk to their children to illustrate a particular point of grammar.

They were then presented in varying brightness and time, with subjects always having to make a choice between two products. The result was that we don't always buy what we like best, but when things have to happen quickly, we tend to go for the product that catches our eye the most. If we are also distracted because we are talking to someone, on the phone, or our thoughts are elsewhere at the moment, our actual preference for a product falls further into the background and visual conspicuousness comes to the fore.

We would 'know' this from the evidence that on a daily basis there is a significant amount of 'cultural' activity all focused on football in terms of the amount of people who play it, watch it, read about it and talk about it. However, within British society not everybody would see football as 'their' game. It could be argued from looking at their 'cultural' activities and habits, that people from a middle-class background seem to prefer rugby over football, or that more women play netball than football. Equally, if you went to the USA and were talking about 'football', most people would assume you were talking about American football rather than soccer.

It was an evening to remember ― black tuxedos and long evening dresses, a high-society event. Present in the audience that evening was a mother with her nine-year-old son. Tired of waiting, he squirmed constantly in his seat. His mother was in hopes that her son would be encouraged to practice the piano if he could just hear the great Paderewski at the keyboard. So, against his wishes, he had come. As she turned to talk with friends, her son could stay seated no longer. He slipped away from her side, strangely drawn to the black concert grand piano and its leather stool on the huge stage flooded with blinding lights. Without much notice from the sophisticated audience, the boy sat down at the piano stool, staring wide-eyed at the black and white keys. He placed his small, shaky fingers in the right location and began to play ""Chopsticks."" The roar of the crowd became quiet as hundreds of frowning faces pointed in his direction. Irritated and embarrassed, they began to shout: ""Get that boy away from there!"" ""Who'd bring a kid that young in here?"" ""Where's his mother?"" ""Stop him!"" Backstage, Paderewski overheard the sounds out front and quickly put together in his mind what was happening. Hurriedly, he grabbed his coat and rushed toward the stage. Without one word of announcement Paderewski bent over behind the boy, reached around both sides, began to improvise a countermelody to harmonize with and enhance ""Chopsticks."" As the two of them played together, he kept whispering in the boy's ear: ""Keep going. Don't quit. Keep on playing... don't stop... don't quit."" Together, the old master and the little boy transformed an embarrassing situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was mesmerized."

Controlled experiments also provide the natural sciences with something seldom available to economists — the chance, or serendipitous, discovery (such as penicillin). Macroeconomists studying the U.S. economy have only one patient, so they can’t introduce particular policies in a variety of alternative settings. You can’t squeeze economies into a test tube.

Some individuals are buried with more precious goods (metals, weapons, and maybe even art), some are in group graves and some by themselves, and still others don’t even seem to be buried at all. The bones from the burials start to show us differences as well — chemical and isotope analyses of teeth and long bones reveal that some members of groups were getting more protein or minerals than others; some have more evidence of diseases and greater physical injuries from their labors.

In a live jazz concert a bass player can provide the audience with a ten-minute jam session but is unable to do so if making a record. Time and space limits on early discs made this liberalized performance style impossible. Often, pieces would be separated into a number of discs leading to a lack of continuity. In addition to length, musicians had to take into account how the machinery recorded and absorbed their sound. Especially in the early days of recording, human voices as well as instruments were often distorted once recorded. To prevent such distortion, it was up to the musician to alter the sound to accommodate the recording technology that was just coming into existence. Jazz musicians and orchestras almost molded their works around recording parameters. Many musicians were receptive to the limitations and benefits of technology and created their records accordingly. The recording limitations began to filter into stage performance. Musicians were restricted to three-minute songs in the recording studio and they soon kept their songs to that length on stage too."

Whereas our immediate ancestors are notably skilled at helping us with the ""little pictures,"" namely the particular, the trees ─ say, a problem with a boss ─ our remote ones are best for seeing the ""Big Picture,"" namely the general, the forest ─ say, the meaning of our job. As modern people rush around blowing small problems out of proportion, thus contributing to a global anxiety epidemic, ancestral spirits have a broader perspective that can calm the disquieted soul. When it comes to a trivial problem, for example, they'll just tell us, ""This too will pass."" They appreciate how rapidly and often things change. According to American anthropologist Richard Katz, for instance, Fijians say that from the ancestral viewpoint whatever looks unfortunate may turn out to be fortunate after all: ""What may seem to be a horrible outcome ... is seen in another light by the ancestors."" The ancestors, it might be said, keep their heads when everyone around them is losing theirs."

Marcus Aurelius, for example, has been dismissed by academics as not being original because his writing resembles that of other, earlier Stoics. This criticism misses the point. Even before Marcus's time, Seneca was well aware that there was a lot of borrowing and overlap among the philosophers. That's because real philosophers weren't concerned with authorship, but only what worked. More important, they believed that what was said mattered less than what was done. And this is true now as it was then. You're welcome to take all of the words of the great philosophers and use them to your own liking (they're dead; they don't mind). Feel free to make adjustments and improvements as you like. Adapt them to the real conditions of the real world. The way to prove that you truly understand what you speak and write, that you truly are original, is to put them into practice."

In early childhood their families accorded them a great deal of respect and allowed them to explore on their own and develop a strong sense of personal autonomy. There was also a lack of extreme emotional closeness with parents. There was little evidence of intensely negative experiences; for example there was, relative to the times in which they lived, very little physical punishment for transgressions. Nor, on the positive side, was there evidence of extremely intense bonds of the sort that can smother independence. On balance, for those who would grow up to be highly creative, relationships with parents were relatively easy and, in later life, pleasant and friendly rather than intensely intimate."

That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."" According to Stanford University psychology professor Lera Boroditsky, that's not necessarily so. Focusing on the grammatical gender differences between German and Spanish, Boroditsky's work indicates that the gender our language assigns to a given noun influences us to subconsciously give that noun characteristics of the grammatical gender. Take the word bridge. In German, bridge (die brucke) is a feminine noun; in Spanish, bridge (el puente) is a masculine noun. Boroditsky found that when asked to describe a bridge, native German speakers used words like beautiful, elegant, slender. When native Spanish speakers were asked the same question, they used words like strong, sturdy, towering. This worked the other way around as well. The word key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. When asked to describe a key, native German speakers used words like jagged, heavy, hard, metal. Spanish speakers used words like intricate, golden, lovely."

This is best witnessed in visual illusions, which we perceive with full confidence, as if there were no doubt that we are portraying reality faithfully. One interesting way of discovering this ─ in a simple game that can be played at any moment ─ is the following. Whenever you are with another person, ask him or her to close their eyes, and start asking questions about what is nearby ─ not very particular details but the most striking elements of the scene. What is the color of the wall? Is there a table in the room? Does that man have a beard? You will see that the majority of us are quite ignorant about what lies around us. This is not so puzzling. The most extraordinary fact is that we completely disregard this ignorance."

One method that has proved effective in research studies is to support some aspects of a complex task while students perform the entire task. For example, Swelter and Cooper demonstrated this with students learning to solve problems in a variety of quantitative fields from statistics to physics. They found that when students were given typical word problems, it was possible for them to solve the problems without actually learning much. This is because the problems themselves were sufficiently demanding that students had no cognitive resources available to learn from what they did. But when students were given ""worked-examples"" (such as pre-solved problems) placed between problems to solve, studying the worked-examples freed up cognitive resources that allowed students to see the key features of the problem and to analyze the steps and reasons behind problem-solving moves. The researchers found this improved students' performance on subsequent problem solving. This result, called the worked-example effect, is one example of a process called scaffolding, by which instructors temporarily relieve some of the cognitive load so that students can focus on particular dimensions of learning."

Its history is tied more broadly to the rise of modern science, philosophy, and politics. The effort to understand the causal relations that govern the physical world so as to intervene in these relations in ways that could, as Francis Bacon put it, ""ameliorate the human condition,"" marked the beginning of modernity in the West. For a long time, the ""domination of nature"" referred to this effort to understand and control the nonhuman environment, and it was seen as a clearly good thing. This effort made possible new technologies and rising economic prosperity, promised an end to many forms of human suffering, and demonstrated the triumph of reason over ignorance and superstition. Its costs began to be visible with industrialization in the nineteenth century, which generated obvious environmental damage and caused among many people a sense of alienation from the land and the more-than-human communities composing it. One sees a growing unease about these costs in novels of the era such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818), in poems like Wordsworth's ""Michael"" (1800) and later Whitman's Leaves of Grass (1855), and in the early nature writing of Thoreau's Walden (1854). Yet systematic, critical analysis of the domination of nature as a problem came into its own only with the environmental studies movement in the 1970s. Since then, the trope has come to have a broadly negative meaning, with the domination of nature being viewed as harmful and illegitimate, as well as dangerous to human interests."

She had a strong desire to make a difference in the world, yet often felt that her efforts were insignificant. One day, Emily crossed paths with Martha, an elderly lady known for her sour mood and tendency to keep to herself. Curiosity sparked within Emily, prompting her to initiate a conversation with Martha. Despite Martha's initial resistance, Emily persistently reached out to her, sharing stories and expressing genuine interest in her life. Through their conversations, Emily discovered that Martha had once been a famous painter. However, she had lost her passion for art due to personal hardships. Deeply moved by her sorrow, Emily resolved to help revive Martha's creative spirit. So, she organized an art exhibition in the town's community center. The event showcased the great works of many local artists, with a special surprise awaiting Martha. Emily had carefully prepared a section dedicated to Martha's paintings, hoping to unveil it to her and the community. The day of the exhibition arrived, and the townspeople eagerly gathered, excited to witness the artistic wonders of their community. Emily anxiously awaited Martha's arrival, wondering how Martha would react to the surprise she had planned. Martha finally entered the exhibition hall, and her eyes filled with tears as she stood in front of her own artworks. Martha slowly made her way through the section dedicated to her paintings, examining each piece with a mix of nostalgia and longing. The crowd watched in silence, their hearts touched by Martha's emotional response. As Martha reached the last painting, she turned to Emily with a bright smile, tears still shining in her eyes. ""Emily, you've given me back a part of myself that I thought was lost forever,"" Martha whispered, her voice shaking with gratitude. ""I had forgotten the joy that art once brought me, but you've reminded me of its power."""

This is music’s greatest asset because it brings out the essential ‘now’ without implications of a past and a potential future. Thus, Stravinsky pointed out that only through music are we able to ‘realize the present.’ Musical ‘meaning’ cannot be separated from the act of presentation. However, the necessity of present-ing music — making it present here and now, without which it will not be music at all — does not sit easily with a concept of education that rests mainly upon received factual knowledge and which, by tradition, uses the past to make sense of the present. If we want music to have a role in general education, it would seem logical to acknowledge this difference and give prominence to activities that will involve all pupils working directly with music. Yet, in spite of numerous attempts to develop a more musical music curriculum for the majority of school pupils, the emphasis is still on pupils absorbing factual information about music."

It may just be that the circumstances at one period of time, or at one location, were more favourable for fossilization than they were at other times, or in other places. Likewise, the absence of hominin fossil evidence at a particular time or place does not have the same implication as its presence. As the saying goes, 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence'. Similar logic suggests that taxa are likely to have arisen before they first appear in the fossil record, and they are likely to have survived beyond the time of their most recent appearance in the fossil record. Thus, the first appearance datum, and the last appearance datum of taxa in the hominin fossil record are likely to be conservative statements about the times of origin and extinction of a taxon."

In one scenario, a man at a black-tie affair was viewed as having higher status and competence when wearing a red bow tie. The researchers also found that valuing uniqueness increased audience members’ ratings of the status and competence of a professor who wore red sneakers while giving a lecture. The results suggest that people judge these slight deviations from the norm as positive because they suggest that the individual is powerful enough to risk the social costs of such behaviors."

If an apology is not accepted, thank the individual for hearing you out and leave the door open for if and when he wishes to reconcile. Be conscious of the fact that just because someone accepts your apology does not mean she has fully forgiven you. It can take time, maybe a long time, before the injured party can completely let go and fully trust you again. There is little you can do to speed this process up. If the person is truly important to you, it is worthwhile to give him or her the time and space needed to heal. Do not expect the person to go right back to acting normally immediately."

It may simply be asking how things are at home. For one student considering dropping out of school, it was a note from me after one of his frequent absences saying that he made my day when I saw him in school. He came to me with the note with tears in his eyes and thanked me. He will graduate this year. Whatever technique is used, the students must know that you care about them.

On the other hand, Japanese tend to do little disclosing about themselves to others except to the few people with whom they are very close. In general, Asians do not reach out to strangers. They do, however, show great care for each other, since they view harmony as essential to relationship improvement.

""Wait a minute! That's not my name!"" he said, puzzled. The letter was addressed to his classmate Stephanie, who had also participated in the contest. Reading on, Steven realized the letter had been delivered mistakenly. ""Unfortunately,"" it should have gone to Stephanie, who was the real winner. He looked at the tickets and then the letter. He had really wanted those tickets. He had planned to go there with his younger sister. Steven was his sister's hero, and he had bragged to her that he would win the contest. However, if she found out that her hero hadn't won, she would be terribly disappointed, and he would feel ashamed. ""If I don't tell Stephanie, perhaps she will never know,"" Steven thought for a moment. He remembered that the winner would only be notified by mail. As long as he kept quiet, nobody would know. So he decided to sleep on it. The next morning, he felt miserable and his dad recognized it right away. ""What's wrong, Son?"" asked his dad. Steven was hesitant at first but soon disclosed his secret. After listening attentively to the end, his dad advised him to do the right thing. Once Steven had heard his dad's words, tears started to fill up in his eyes. ""I was foolish,"" Steven said regretfully. He took the letter and the prize to school and handed them to Stephanie. He congratulated her wholeheartedly and she was thrilled. On the way home after school, his steps were light and full of joy. That night, his dad was very pleased to hear what he had done at school. ""I am so proud of you, Steven,"" he said. Then, without a word, he handed Steven two Ace Amusement Park tickets and winked."

The kindergartener wanted to know what his family members were up to, and was checking up on everyone. While checking on his family, Sean interfered in their business as if it was his own. This time, the playful and curious boy was interested in his brother Felix, who committed himself to studying no matter where he was. Sean secretly looked inside his brother's room from the door, and shouted toward the kitchen where Mom was working, ""Mom, Felix isn't studying. He's just watching a funny video."" Sean was naughtily smiling at his brother. Felix was mad because his little brother was bothering him. Felix was studying science using a video posted on the school web site. He made an angry face at the naughty boy. Right then, Mom asked loudly from the kitchen, ""What are you doing, Felix?"" Felix's room was located next to the kitchen, and he could hear Mom clearly. ""I'm watching a lecture video for my science class."" Felix argued against Sean's accusation and mischievously stuck his tongue out at his little brother. ""All right. I'm sure you're doing your work."" Mom replied, and then sharply added a question. ""Sean, what are you doing?"" Sean's face immediately became blank, and he said, ""Nothing."" ""Come here, Honey, and you can help me."" Sean ran to the kitchen right away. ""What can I do for you, Mom?"" His voice was high, and Felix could sense that his brother was excited. Felix was pleased to get rid of the policeman, and now he could concentrate on the lesson, at least till Sean came back."

The concept includes a claim that we should be unobserved, and that certain information and images about us should not be circulated without our permission. Why did these privacy claims arise? They arose because powerful people took offence at such observation. Furthermore, privacy incorporated the need to protect the family, home, and correspondence from arbitrary interference and, in addition, there has been a determination to protect honour and reputation. How is privacy protected? Historically, privacy was protected by restricting circulation of the damaging material. But if the concept of privacy first became interesting legally as a response to reproductions of images through photography and newspapers, more recent technological advances, such as data storage, digital images, and the Internet, pose new threats to privacy. The right to privacy is now being reinterpreted to meet those challenges."

In animals, play has long been seen as a way of learning and practicing skills and behaviors that are necessary for future survival. In children, too, play has important functions during development. From its earliest beginnings in infancy, play is a way in which children learn about the world and their place in it. Children's play serves as a training ground for developing physical abilities ― skills like walking, running, and jumping that are necessary for everyday living. Play also allows children to try out and learn social behaviors and to acquire values and personality traits that will be important in adulthood. For example, they learn how to compete and cooperate with others, how to lead and follow, how to make decisions, and so on."

These students were victims of distractions who found it very difficult to study anywhere except in their private bedrooms. In today's world, it is impossible to run away from distractions.

Just as important, the Internet opened up a forum for customers to compare products, experiences, and values with other customers easily and quickly.

Orphaned at the age of seven, her early life was marked by hardship. In 1888, she moved to St. Louis, where she worked as a washerwoman for more than a decade, earning barely more than a dollar a day. During this time, long hours of backbreaking labor and a poor diet caused her hair to fall out. She tried everything that was available but had no success. After working as a maid for a chemist, she invented a successful hair care product and sold it across the country. Not only did she sell, she also recruited and trained lots of women as sales agents for a share of the profits. In the process she became America's first self-made female millionaire and she gave Black women everywhere an opportunity for financial independence."

One of the various physical changes caused by domestication is a reduction in the size of the brain: 16 percent for horses, 34 percent for pigs, and 10 to 30 percent for dogs. This is because once humans started to take care of these animals, they no longer needed various brain functions in order to survive. Animals who were fed and protected by humans did not need many of the skills required by their wild ancestors and lost the parts of the brain related to those capacities. A similar process occurred for humans, who seem to have been domesticated by wolves. About 10,000 years ago, when the role of dogs was firmly established in most human societies, the human brain also shrank by about 10 percent."

In other words, it means the extraction of more fuel and raw materials from a mouthful of food. This is especially important for mammals because they heat their bodies from within. Chewing gives mammals the energy needed to be active not only during the day but also the cool night, and to live in colder climates or places with changing temperatures. It allows them to sustain higher levels of activity and travel speeds to cover larger distances, avoid predators, capture prey, and make and care for their young.

No species can detect all the molecules that are present in the environment in which it lives ― there are some things that we cannot smell but which some other animals can, and vice versa. There are also differences between individuals, relating to the ability to smell an odour, or how pleasant it seems. For example, some people like the taste of coriander ― known as cilantro in the USA ― while others find it soapy and unpleasant. This effect has an underlying genetic component due to differences in the genes controlling our sense of smell. Ultimately, the selection of scents detected by a given species, and how that odour is perceived, will depend upon the animal's ecology. The response profile of each species will enable it to locate sources of smell that are relevant to it and to respond accordingly."

The term is derived from the 15th-century Medici family, who helped usher in the Renaissance by bringing together artists, writers, and other creatives from all over the world. Arguably, the Renaissance was a result of the exchange of ideas between these different groups in close contact with each other. Sound familiar? If you are unable to diversify your own talent and skill, then having others around you to compensate might very well just do the trick. Believing that all new ideas come from combining existing notions in creative ways, Johansson recommends utilizing a mix of backgrounds, experiences, and expertise in staffing to bring about the best possible solutions, perspectives, and innovations in business."

Things only fossilize under certain sets of conditions. Modern insect communities are highly diverse in tropical forests, but the recent fossil record captures little of that diversity. Many creatures are consumed entirely or decompose rapidly when they die, so there may be no fossil record at all for important groups. It's a bit similar to a family photo album. Maybe when you were born your parents took lots of pictures, but over the years they took photographs occasionally, and sometimes they got busy and forgot to take pictures at all. Very few of us have a complete photo record of our life. Fossils are just like that. Sometimes you get very clear pictures of the past, while at other times there are big gaps, and you need to notice what they are."

What's interesting is that the company turned down over 95 percent of those offers and began serving only four new locations. It turned down tremendous growth because company leadership had set an upper limit for growth. Sure, its executives wanted to grow each year, but they didn't want to grow too much. Unlike other famous companies, they wanted to set their own pace, one that could be sustained in the long term. By doing this, they established a safety margin for growth that helped them continue to thrive at a time when the other airlines were flailing."

The camera automatically turns on the flash as there is not enough light available to produce a correct exposure. The result is half of your friends appear in the picture with two bright red circles instead of their eyes. This is a common problem called the red-eye effect. It is caused because the light from the flash penetrates the eyes through the pupils, and then gets reflected to the camera from the back of the eyes where a large amount of blood is present. This blood is the reason why the eyes look red in the photograph. This effect is more noticeable when there is not much light in the environment. This is because pupils dilate when it is dark, allowing more light to get inside the eye and producing a larger red-eye effect."

In fact, the two variables may merely seem to be associated with each other due to the effect of some third variable. Sociologists call such misleading relationships spurious. A classic example is the apparent association between children's shoe size and reading ability. It seems that as shoe size increases, reading ability improves. Does this mean that the size of one's feet (independent variable) causes an improvement in reading skills (dependent variable)? Certainly not. This false relationship is caused by a third factor, age, that is related to shoe size as well as reading ability. Hence, when researchers attempt to make causal claims about the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable, they must control for ― or rule out ― other variables that may be creating a spurious relationship."

In the other, a woman was speaking Spanish. Then they were shown a screen with both women side by side, not speaking. In infant psychology research, the standard measure for affinity or interest is attention ― babies will apparently stare longer at the things they like more. In Kinzler's study, the babies stared at the English speakers longer. In other studies, researchers have found that infants are more likely to take a toy offered by someone who speaks the same language as them.

At the same time, these primitive hominins would not have simply made random sounds or gestures. Instead, they would have used means to communicate that they believed others would understand. And they also thought their hearers could ""fill in the gaps"", and connect their knowledge of their culture and the world to interpret what was uttered. These are some of the reasons why the origins of human language cannot be effectively discussed unless conversation is placed at the top of the list of things to understand. Every aspect of human language has evolved, as have components of the human brain and body, to engage in conversation and social life. Language did not fully begin when the first hominid uttered the first word or sentence. It began in earnest only with the first conversation, which is both the source and the goal of language. Indeed, language changes lives. It builds society and expresses our highest aspirations, our basest thoughts, our emotions and our philosophies of life. But all language is ultimately at the service of human interaction. Other components of language ― things like grammar and stories ― are secondary to conversation."

He studied law and mathematics at his university, and then devoted some time to his own research, initially in mathematics but then also in optics, working on telescopes and grinding his own lenses. Huygens visited England several times, and met Isaac Newton in 1689. In addition to his work on light, Huygens had studied forces and motion, but he did not accept Newton's law of universal gravitation. Huygens' wide-ranging achievements included some of the most accurate clocks of his time, the result of his work on pendulums.

Airways have fixed widths and defined altitudes, which separate traffic moving in opposite directions. Vertical separation of aircraft allows some flights to pass over airports while other processes occur below. Air travel usually covers long distances, with short periods of intense pilot activity at takeoff and landing and long periods of lower pilot activity while in the air, the portion of the flight known as the ""long haul."" During the long-haul portion of a flight, pilots spend more time assessing aircraft status than searching out nearby planes. This is because collisions between aircraft usually occur in the surrounding area of airports, while crashes due to aircraft malfunction tend to occur during long-haul flight."

In chess, it is only after the basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more effortful thinking. This is true for anything you attempt. When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence. However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide.

For, as writing theorists often note, writing is generally not a process in which we start with a fully formed idea in our heads that we then simply transcribe in an unchanged state onto the page. On the contrary, writing is more often a means of discovery in which we use the writing process to figure out what our idea is. This is why writers are often surprised to find that what they end up with on the page is quite different from what they thought it would be when they started. What we are trying to say here is that everyday language is often crucial for this discovery process.

A specific gene instructed one twin to develop cancer, but in the other the same gene did not initiate the disease. One possibility is that the healthy twin had a diet that turned off the cancer gene - the same gene that instructed the other person to get sick. For many years, scientists have recognized other environmental factors, such as chemical toxins (tobacco for example), can contribute to cancer through their actions on genes.

Agriculture both supports and requires more people to grow the crops that sustain them. Estimates vary, of course, but evidence points to an increase in the human population from 1-5 million people worldwide to a few hundred million once agriculture had become established. And a larger population doesn't just mean increasing the size of everything, like buying a bigger box of cereal for a larger family. It brings qualitative changes in the way people live. For example, more people means more kinds of diseases, particularly when those people are sedentary.

These distances determine the functioning of the so-called 'flight or fight' mechanism. As an animal senses what it considers to be a predator approaching within its 'flight' distance, it will quite simply run away. The distance at which this happens is amazingly consistent, and Hediger, a Swiss biologist, claimed to have measured it remarkably precisely for some of the species that he studied. Naturally, it varies from species to species, and usually the larger the animal the longer its flight distance. I have had to use a long focus lens to take photographs of giraffes, which have very large flight distances. By contrast, I have several times nearly stepped on a squirrel in my garden before it drew attention to itself by suddenly escaping! We can only assume that this variation in distance matches the animal's own assessment of its ability to accelerate and run. The 'fight' distance is always smaller than the flight distance. If a perceived predator approaches within the flight distance but the animal is trapped by obstacles or other predators and cannot flee, it must stand its ground. Eventually, however, attack becomes the best form of defence, and so the trapped animal will turn and fight."

The patient's death 18 days later did not weaken the spirits of those who welcomed a new era of medicine. The ability to perform heart transplants was linked to the development of respirators, which had been introduced to hospitals in the 1950s. Respirators could save many lives, but not all those whose hearts kept beating ever recovered any other significant functions. In some cases, their brains had ceased to function altogether. The realization that such patients could be a source of organs for transplantation led to the setting up of the Harvard Brain Death Committee, and to its recommendation that the absence of all ""discernible central nervous system activity"" should be ""a new criterion for death"".

It shows that we make our decisions based on the recency of events. We often misjudge the frequency and magnitude of the events that have happened recently because of the limitations of our memories. According to Harvard professor, Max Bazerman, managers conducting performance appraisals often fall victim to the availability heuristic. The recency of events highly influences a supervisor's opinion during performance appraisals. Managers give more weight to performance during the three months prior to the evaluation than to the previous nine months of the evaluation period because the recent instances dominate their memories. The availability heuristic is influenced by the ease of recall or retrievability of information of some event. Ease of recall suggests that if something is more easily recalled in your memory, you think that it will occur with a high probability."

Computers can process data accurately at far greater speeds than people can, yet they are limited in many respects ― most importantly, they lack common sense. However, combining the strengths of these machines with human strengths creates synergy. Synergy occurs when combined resources produce output that exceeds the sum of the outputs of the same resources employed separately. A computer works quickly and accurately; humans work relatively slowly and make mistakes. A computer cannot make independent decisions, however, or formulate steps for solving problems, unless programmed to do so by humans. Even with sophisticated artificial intelligence, which enables the computer to learn and then implement what it learns, the initial programming must be done by humans. Thus, a human‒computer combination allows the results of human thought to be translated into efficient processing of large amounts of data."

As the machinery was new, it continued to produce results and, therefore, the organization's profitability soared and the manager was appreciated for his performance. Now after some time, this manager was promoted and transferred to a different location. A new manager came in his place to be in charge of running the manufacturing location. But this manager realized that with heavy utilization and without any downtime for maintenance, a lot of the parts of the machinery were significantly worn and needed to be replaced or repaired. The new manager had to put significant time and effort into repair and maintenance of the machines, which resulted in lower production and thus a loss of profits. The earlier manager had only taken care of the goal of production and ignored the machinery although he had short‒term good results.

Every Christmas season, knowing how much children loved presents at Christmas, Maria tried to arrange a special visit from Santa Claus for one family. Alice, the seven‒year‒old daughter of Maria, was very enthusiastic about helping with her mother's Christmas event. This year's lucky family was a 25‒year‒old mother named Karen and her 3‒year‒old son, who she was raising by herself. However, things went wrong. Two weeks before Christmas Day, a representative from a local organization called Maria to say that the aid she had requested for Karen had fallen through. No Santa Claus. No presents. Maria saw the cheer disappear from Alice's face at the news. After hearing this, she ran to her room. When Alice returned, her face was set with determination. She counted out the coins from her piggy bank: $4.30. ""Mom,"" she told Maria, ""I know it's not much. But maybe this will buy a present for the kid."" Maria gave her daughter a lovely hug. The next day, Maria told her coworkers about her daughter's latest project. To her surprise, staff members began to open their purses. The story of Alice's gift had spread beyond Maria's office, and Maria was able to raise $300 ― plenty for a Christmas gift for Karen and her son. On Christmas Eve, Maria and Alice visited Karen's house with Christmas gifts. When Karen opened the door, Maria and Alice wished the astonished woman a merry Christmas. Then Alice began to unload the gifts from the car, handing them to Karen one by one. Karen laughed in disbelief, and said she hoped she would one day be able to do something similar for someone else in need. On her way home, Maria said to Alice, ""God multiplied your gift."""

This “Mum Effect” — a term coined by psychologists Sidney Rosen and Abraham Tesser in the early 1970s— happens because people want to avoid becoming the target of others’ negative emotions. We all have the opportunity to lead change, yet it often requires of us the courage to deliver bad news to our superiors. We don’t want to be the innocent messenger who falls before a firing line. When our survival instincts kick in, they can override our courage until the truth of a situation gets watered down. “The Mum Effect and the resulting filtering can have devastating effects in a steep hierarchy,” writes Robert Sutton, an organizational psychologist. “What starts out as bad news becomes happier and happier as it travels up the ranks ― because after each boss hears the news from his or her subordinates, he or she makes it sound a bit less bad before passing it up the chain.”"

In all societies humor is important not only in individual communication but also as a molding force of social groups, reinforcing their norms and regulating behavior. ""Each particular time, each era, in fact each moment, has its own condition and themes for laughter... because of the major preoccupations, concerns, interests, activities, relations, and mode prevailing at the time."" The ultimate goal of anyone who studies another culture, such as ancient Greece, is to understand the people themselves who were more than the sum total of monuments, historical incidents, or social groupings. One way to approach this goal directly is to study the culture's humor. As Goethe aptly observed: ""Men show their characters in nothing more clearly than in what they think laughable."""

The idea is simple and powerful. By specializing in just one activity ― such as food raising, clothing production, or home construction ― each worker gains mastery over the particular activity. Specialization makes sense, however, only if the specialist can subsequently trade his or her output with the output of specialists in other lines of activity. It would make no sense to produce more food than a household needs unless there is a market outlet to exchange that excess food for clothing, shelter, and so forth. At the same time, without the ability to buy food on the market, it would not be possible to be a specialist home builder or clothing maker, since it would be necessary to farm for one’s own survival. Thus Smith realized that the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market, whereas the extent of the market is determined by the degree of specialization."

Finally, the screen was removed to reveal either the face of the dog's human companion or a stranger's face. The dogs' reactions were videotaped. Naturally, the dogs were attentive to the sound of their name, and they typically stared about six seconds at the face after the screen was removed.

The patterns and melodies we hear are pre-planned and intended. Some African tribal music, however, results from collaboration by the players on the spur of the moment. The patterns heard, whether they are the silences when all players rest on a beat or the accented beats when all play together, are not planned but serendipitous. When an overall silence appears on beats 4 and 13, it is not because each musician is thinking, ""On beats 4 and 13, I will rest."" Rather, it occurs randomly as the patterns of all the players converge upon a simultaneous rest. The musicians are probably as surprised as their listeners to hear the silences at beats 4 and 13. Surely that surprise is one of the joys tribal musicians experience in making their music."

As a result, their biotas show fewer clear differences than those on land. The oceans themselves are continually moving because the water within each ocean basin slowly rotates. These moving waters carry marine organisms from place to place, and also help the dispersal of their young or larvae. Furthermore, the gradients between the environments of different areas of ocean water mass are very gradual and often extend over wide areas that are inhabited by a great variety of organisms of differing ecological tolerances. There are no firm boundaries within the open oceans although there may be barriers to the movement of organisms."

The change might mean that you lose privileges or prestige. Perhaps with the change you lose the closeness of a person or a place. In life, all these things come and go and then others appear, which will also go. It is like a river in constant movement. If we try to stop the flow, we create a dam; the water stagnates and causes a pressure which accumulates inside us.

They are essential to the car's ability to move, and they impact both safety and performance. Yet tires generally do not influence purchase decisions because safety standards guarantee that all tires will be very safe and reliable. Differences in interior features ― optimal sound system, portable technology docks, number and location of cup holders ― likely have far more effect on the consumer's buying decision. In terms of the overall value of an automobile, you can't drive without tires, but you can drive without cup holders and a portable technology dock.

Then, each month for seven months, participants recorded how many hours they had dedicated to their activity, and completed a scale measuring their belief in their ability to effectively do their job, or their ""self-efficacy."" The researchers found that when participants spent longer than normal doing their leisure activity, their belief in their ability to perform their job increased. But this was only the case when they had a serious hobby that was dissimilar to their job. When their hobby was both serious and similar to their job, then spending more time on it actually decreased their self-efficacy."

The program has resulted in numerous improvements to aviation safety. It wasn't easy to establish: pilots had severe self-induced social pressures against admitting to errors. Moreover, to whom would they report them? Certainly not to their employers. Not even to the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), for then they would probably be punished. The solution was to let the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) set up a voluntary accident reporting system whereby pilots could submit semi-anonymous reports of errors they had made or observed in others. Once NASA personnel had acquired the necessary information, they would detach the contact information from the report and mail it back to the pilot. This meant that NASA no longer knew who had reported the error, which made it impossible for the airline companies or the FAA (which enforced penalties against errors) to find out who had submitted the report. If the FAA had independently noticed the error and tried to invoke a civil penalty or certificate suspension, the receipt of self-report automatically exempted the pilot from punishment. When a sufficient number of similar errors had been collected, NASA would analyze them and issue reports and recommendations to the airlines and to the FAA. These reports also helped the pilots realize that their error reports were valuable tools for increasing safety."

However, the pain persisted and was worse than before. At last, he heard about a monk who was famous for treating patients with his condition. Within a few days, the monk was called for by the suffering man. The monk understood the wealthy man’s problem and said that for some time he should concentrate only on green colours and not let his eyes see any other colours. The wealthy man thought it was a strange prescription, but he was desperate and decided to try it. He got together a group of painters and purchased barrels of green paint and ordered that every object he was likely to see be painted green just as the monk had suggested. In a few days everything around that man was green. The wealthy man made sure that nothing around him could be any other colour. When the monk came to visit him after a few days, the wealthy man’s servants ran with buckets of green paint and poured them all over him because he was wearing red clothes. He asked the servants why they did that. They replied, “We can’t let our master see any other colour.” Hearing this, the monk laughed and said “If only you had purchased a pair of green glasses for just a few dollars, you could have saved these walls, trees, pots, and everything else and you could have saved a large share of his fortune.

We tend to walk in circles for several reasons. The most important is that virtually no human has two legs of the exact same length. One leg is always slightly longer than the other, and this causes us to turn without even noticing it. In addition, if you are hiking with a backpack on, the weight of that backpack will inevitably throw you off balance. Our dominant hand factors into the mix too.

If full communication with a potential counterparty in a deal is not possible, then uncertainty and probably a measure of distrust will remain. As economic life became more complex in the later Middle Ages, the need for fuller and more precise communication was accentuated.

Instead of blood contained in vessels, they have free-flowing hemolymph, which helps keep their bodies rigid, aids movement, and assists the transportation of nutrients and waste materials to the appropriate parts of the body.

The appearance and subsequent evolution of exceedingly primitive living organisms (bacteria-like microbes and simple single-celled plants) began to change the atmosphere, liberating oxygen and breaking down carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. This made it possible for higher organisms to develop. When the earliest known plant cells with nuclei evolved about 2 billion years ago, the atmosphere seems to have had only about 1 percent of its present content of oxygen. With the emergence of the first land plants, about 500 million years ago, oxygen reached about one-third of its present concentration. It had risen to almost its present level by about 370 million years ago, when animals first spread on to land. Today's atmosphere is thus not just a requirement to sustain life as we know it ― it is also a consequence of life."

Memories associated with important emotions tend to be more deeply embedded in our memory than other events. Emotional memories are more likely to be vividly remembered and are more likely to be recalled with the passing of time than neutral memories. Since music can be extremely emotionally evocative, key life events can be emotionally heightened by the presence of music, ensuring that memories of the event become deeply encoded. Retrieval of those memories is then enhanced by contextual effects, in which a recreation of a similar context to that in which the memories were encoded can facilitate their retrieval. Thus, re-hearing the same music associated with the event can activate intensely vivid memories of the event."

Many African cultures saw the head as the center of control, communication, and identity in the body. Hair was regarded as a source of power that personified the individual and could be used for spiritual purposes or even to cast a spell. Since it rests on the highest point on the body, hair itself was a means to communicate with divine spirits and it was treated in ways that were thought to bring good luck or protect against evil.

Strong ties can be more homophilistic. Our closest friends are often those who are most like us. This means that they might have information that is most relevant to us, but it also means that it is information to which we may already be exposed.

Not everyone could understand the compositions of Beethoven, Brahms, or Stravinsky in their day. The reason for this initial lack of acceptance is unfamiliarity. The musical forms, or ideas expressed within them, were completely new. And yet, this is exactly one of the things that makes them so great. Effective composers have their own ideas. Have you ever seen the classic movie Amadeus? The composer Antonio Salieri is the ""host"" of this movie; he's depicted as one of the most famous non-great composers ― he lived at the time of Mozart and was completely overshadowed by him. Now, Salieri wasn't a bad composer; in fact, he was a very good one. But he wasn't one of the world's great composers because his work wasn't original. What he wrote sounded just like what everyone else was composing at the time."

If you put two monkeys in cages next to each other, and offer them both slices of cucumber for the rocks they already have, they will happily eat the cucumbers. If, however, you give one monkey grapes instead ― grapes being universally preferred to cucumbers ― the monkey that is still receiving cucumbers will begin to throw them back at the experimenter. Even though she is still getting ""paid"" the same amount for her effort of sourcing rocks, and so her particular situation has not changed, the comparison to another makes the situation unfair.

You see this in a river, or when you turn on a tap, or if you use a spoon to stir your coffee. When you jump off a diving board and hit a body of water, the water has to flow away from you. But the flowing takes time, and if your speed of impact is too great, the water won't be able to flow away fast enough, and so it pushes back at you. It's that force that stings your skin as you belly-flop into a pool, and makes falling into water from a great height like landing on concrete.

More recent research has shown that ideas ― even emotional states and conditions ― can be transmitted through a social network. The evidence of this kind of contagion is clear: 'Students with studious roommates become more studious. Diners sitting next to heavy eaters eat more food.' However, according to Christakis and Fowler, we cannot transmit ideas and behaviours much beyond our friends' friends' friends (in other words, across just three degrees of separation). This is because the transmission and reception of an idea or behaviour requires a stronger connection than the relaying of a letter or the communication that a certain employment opportunity exists. Merely knowing people is not the same as being able to influence them to study more or over-eat. Imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, even when it is unconscious."

Fossil evidence shows that as far back as 130,000 years ago, it was not unusual for Homo sapiens to travel more than a hundred and fifty miles to trade, share food and, no doubt, gossip. Unlike the Neanderthals, their social groups extended far beyond their own families. Remembering all those connections, who was related to whom, and where they lived required considerable processing power. It also required wayfinding savvy. Imagine trying to maintain a social network across tens or hundreds of square miles of Palaeolithic wilderness. You couldn't send a text message to your friends to find out where they were ― you had to go out and visit them, remember where you last saw them or imagine where they might have gone. To do this, you needed navigation skills, spatial awareness, a sense of direction, the ability to store maps of the landscape in your mind and the motivation to travel around. Canadian anthropologist Ariane Burke believes that our ancestors developed all these attributes while trying to keep in touch with their neighbours. Eventually, our brains became primed for wayfinding. Meanwhile the Neanderthals, who didn't travel as far, never fostered a spatial skill set; despite being sophisticated hunters, well adapted to the cold and able to see in the dark, they went extinct. In the prehistoric badlands, nothing was more useful than a circle of friends."

The result is a group polarization that follows graduates into the real world. As the sociologist Diana C. Mutz discovered in her book Hearing the Other Side, those with the highest levels of education have the lowest exposure to people with conflicting points of view, while those who have not graduated from high school can claim the most diverse discussion mates. In other words, those most likely to live in the tightest echo chambers are those with the highest level of education. It should be the opposite, shouldn't it?

Instead of seeing stress as a threat, the military culture derives pride from the shared resilience it creates.

Instead, they show up every day and put their hands on the keyboard, their pen to paper, and they move their stories forward, bit by bit, word by word, perhaps not even recognizing that inspiration is striking in hundreds of tiny, microscopic ways as they push through another sentence, another page, another chapter.

That, in turn, required exact knowledge of the personal history and accomplishments of each of their groupmates, and equally they needed an empathetic sense of the feelings and propensities of others.

Instead, his explanation focused on the discrepancy between the interests of individual households and those of society as a whole. To understand excessive reproduction as a tragedy of the commons, bear in mind that a typical household stands to gain from bringing another child into the world ― in terms of the net contributions he or she makes to household earnings, for example. But while parents can be counted on to assess how the well-being of their household is affected by additional offspring, they overlook other impacts of population growth, such as diminished per capita food supplies for other people. In other words, the costs of reproduction are largely shared, rather than being shouldered entirely by individual households. As a result, reproduction is excessive."

Such an environment is far different from one where children are shaped by rewards for winning (alone), praise for the best grades, criticism or non-selection despite making their best effort, or coaches whose style is to hand out unequal recognition.

Try to specify the necessary and sufficient condition for something qualifying as art and you'll always find an exception to your criteria.

The cycle of weather reinforced this idea: a puddle of water on the ground gradually dries out, disappears, and then falls later as rain. They reasoned that there must be particles of water that turn into steam, form clouds, and fall to earth, so that the water is conserved even though the little particles are too small to see.

They may believe that the cost and delay of seeking a patent are too great or that secrecy better protects their investment and increases their profit. They might also believe that the invention can best be utilized over a longer period of time than a patent would allow. Without any special legal protection for trade secrets, however, the secretive inventor risks that an employee or contractor will disclose the proprietary information.

Correcting the students requires a high level of sensitivity on the part of the teacher. It does not mean that there is no need to correct, but the correction should not lead to silencing the student. An authoritarian form of correction often prompts even the very brightest of students to withdraw from an uncomfortable situation, let alone those students who are less secure about their own intellectual potential. It also kills the willingness to entertain more risky interpretations. Instead of simply accepting any interpretation just for the sake of the freedom of expression, it is most advisable to question the student about how he/she arrived at their interpretation. This approach creates a community of thinkers, who demonstrate that what is at stake is not the superiority of the opinion based on the hierarchy of the author, but a realization that we belong together in our investigating the matter in question."

But for every patient seeking help in becoming more organized, self-controlled, and responsible about her future, there is a waiting room full of people hoping to loosen up, lighten up, and worry less about the stupid things they said at yesterday's staff meeting or about the rejection they are sure will follow tomorrow's lunch date. For most people, their subconscious sees too many things as bad and not enough as good. It makes sense. If you were designing the mind of a fish, would you have it respond as strongly to opportunities as to threats? No way. The cost of missing a cue that signals food is low; odds are that there are other fish in the sea, and one mistake won't lead to starvation. The cost of missing the sign of a nearby predator, however, can be catastrophic. Game over, end of the line for those genes. Of course, evolution has no designer, but minds created by natural selection end up looking (to us) as though they were designed because they generally produce behavior that is flexibly adaptive in their ecological niches. Some commonalities of animal life even create similarities across species that we might call design principles. One such principle is that bad is stronger than good. Responses to threats and unpleasantness are faster, stronger, and harder to inhibit than responses to opportunities and pleasures."

Scholars who emphasize the visual bias in Western culture even point to science as their favorite example. Because doing research seems impossible without using images, graphs, and diagrams, science is ― in their view ― a visual endeavor par excellence. Historians and sociologists of science have recently corrected this claim by showing how senses other than seeing, including listening, have been significant in the development of knowledge, notable in the laboratory. They stress that scientific work involves more than visual observation. The introduction of measurement devices that merely seem to require the reading of results and thus seeing has not ruled out the deployment of the scientists' other senses. On the contrary, scientific work in experimental settings often calls for bodily skills, one of which is listening. The world of science itself, however, still considers listening a less objective entrance into knowledge production than seeing."

In 1964, he became the first non-Hawaiian to win a major surfing contest at Makaha beach, Hawaii. After more than forty years, by then fairly forgotten in this part of the world, he happened to be passing through Hawaii with his wife, and decided to go back to the beach for a look. Things on the beachfront had changed a lot. The beach and surf, however, were as pure and magical as ever, so he was eager to ride on the Hawaiian surf once again. While his wife stayed in the car, Farrelly took his board out. The further out he got, the more freedom he felt. In the gathering dusk, just one other surfer was there, a large native Hawaiian. Farrelly, an Australian visitor to these shores, kept his distance. But the other surfer soon paddled over. ""Hey, Bernard,"" he said, by way of greeting, in his thick Hawaiian accent. The Hawaiian remembered him, and they talked of times past. They talked of Bernard's winning in Makaha, of the beautiful waves in Hawaii, of what had happened in the beach since. This, Farrelly was thinking, is the real Hawaii experience, not the stuff on the shore. ""Hey, Bernard,"" the man spoke again as there came a big wave, and he moved his own board well out of the way, ""you take this wave."" It was classic Hawaiian culture, where giving what you have is always the first order of things. Farrelly thanked him and farewelled him at the moment the swell rose to a roaring beauty. With the setting sun, he was surfing his way back to his wife. ""That,"" he told her, ""was the perfect wave."""

It may come as a surprise that about one-third of the human brain is devoted to vision. The brain has to perform an enormous amount of work to unambiguously interpret the billions of photons streaming into the eyes. Strictly speaking, all visual scenes are ambiguous. Your brain goes through a good deal of trouble to disambiguate the information hitting your eyes by taking context into account and making assumptions. But all this doesn't happen effortlessly, as demonstrated by patients who surgically recover their eyesight after decades of blindness: they do not suddenly see the world, but instead must learn to see again. At first the world is a chaotic attack of shapes and colors, and even when the optics of their eyes are perfectly functional, their brain must learn how to interpret the data coming in."

In general, mental representations can help us learn. Some of the best evidence for this comes from the field of musical performance. Several researchers have examined what differentiates the best musicians from lesser ones, and one of the major differences lies in the quality of the mental representations the best ones create. When practicing a new piece, advanced musicians have a very detailed mental representation of the music they use to guide their practice and, ultimately, their performance of a piece. In particular, they use their mental representations to provide their own feedback so that they know how close they are to getting the piece right and what they need to do differently to improve. The beginners and intermediate students may have crude representations of the music that allow them to tell, for instance, when they hit a wrong note, but they must rely on feedback from their teachers to identify the more subtle mistakes and weaknesses."

While playing, the young animal may be at great risk. For example, 86 percent of young Southern fur seals eaten by sea lions were play-swimming with others when they were caught. Against these costs many functions have been proposed for play, including practice for adult behaviours such as hunting or fighting, and for developing motor and social interaction skills. However, for these theories, there is little experimental evidence in animals. For example, detailed studies which tracked juvenile play and adult behaviour of meerkats couldn't prove that play-fighting influenced fighting ability as an adult. Therefore, the persistence of play across so many animal species remains a mystery. The answers are likely to involve diverse and multiple factors, which may be quite different in different species, as might what we call play itself."

Significant work has been done on how the brain responds to metaphor, for example. Participants in these studies read familiar or clichéd metaphors like 'a rough day' and these stimulated only the language-sensitive parts of the brain. The metaphor 'a liquid chocolate voice', on the other hand, stimulated areas of the brain concerned both with language ― and with taste. 'A leathery face' stimulated the sensory cortex.

Musical formulas are well known ― for example, the song form A-B-A, or the formula I-IV-V-I in harmony. But music cannot be reduced to such form(ula)s; it needs to deploy them in its sounds' time and space. The aim of this deployment is the gestural action of musicians. In other words, music transfers formulas into gestures when performers interpret the written notes, and when the composers unfold formulas into the score's gestures. Similarly, mathematicians do mathematics; they don't just observe eternal formulas. They move symbols from one side of an equation to the other. Mathematics thrives by intense and highly disciplined actions. You will never understand mathematics if you do not ""play"" with its symbols. However, the mathematical goal is not a manipulatory activity; it is the achievement of a formula that condenses your manipulatory gestures. Mathematics, therefore, shares with music a movement between gestures and formulas, but it moves in the opposite direction of the musical process."

However, that is exactly what almost happened ― many times, in fact. From the fossil record and from DNA analysis, we can tell that our ancestors nearly went extinct, and their population shrunk to very small numbers countless times. In addition, there are many lineages of hominids that did go extinct. Since the split between our ancestors and those of the chimps, our lineage has not been a single line of gradual change. Evolution never works that way. Many branches broke off from each other and developed branches of their own, instead. There were at least three or four different species of hominids living simultaneously for most of the past five million years. Of all these branches, only one survived until today: ours."

Along with those grains, however, farmers selected their toughest weeds without noticing they were there. That would not have been an easy task, and as a result, rye became one of the main weeds. When wheat and barley cultivation was expanded, rye went along for the ride, also expanding its own distribution area. Having arrived in regions with colder winters or poorer soils, rye proved its strength by producing more and better crops than the wheat and barley it had attached itself to, and in a short time it replaced them. Rye had become a domesticated plant. That is where the history of rye begins, in the unenviable role of weeds. Since the ancestors of rye were very similar to wheat and barley, to eliminate them, the ancient populations of the Fertile Crescent would have had to carefully search their seeds for invaders."

It released chemicals that give us that familiar fear, that sinking sense of guilt we get when we lie. But then the researchers went one step further. They rewarded people for lying. They gave them a small monetary reward for deceiving their partner without them knowing they'd been lied to. Once people started getting rewarded for lying and not getting caught, that amygdala-driven sense of guilt started to fade. Interestingly, it faded most markedly when the lie would hurt someone else but help the person telling it. So people started telling bigger and bigger lies.

This life-giving substance is not, however, distributed evenly with depth in the oceans. Oxygen levels are typically high in a thin surface layer 10–20 metres deep. Here oxygen from the atmosphere can freely diffuse into the seawater, plus there is plenty of floating plant life producing oxygen through photosynthesis. Oxygen concentration then decreases rapidly with depth and reaches very low levels, sometimes close to zero, at depths of around 200–1,000 metres. This region is referred to as the oxygen minimum zone. This zone is created by the low rates of oxygen diffusing down from the surface layer of the ocean, combined with the high rates of consumption of oxygen by decaying organic matter that sinks from the surface and accumulates at these depths. Beneath this zone, oxygen content increases again with depth. The deep oceans contain quite high levels of oxygen, though not generally as high as in the surface layer. The higher levels of oxygen in the deep oceans reflect in part the origin of deep-ocean seawater masses, which are derived from cold, oxygen-rich seawater in the surface of polar oceans. That seawater sinks rapidly down, thereby exhausting its oxygen content. As well, compared to life in near-surface waters, organisms in the deep ocean are comparatively scarce and have low metabolic rates. These organisms therefore consume little of the available oxygen."

For example, when a 12-year-old is cut from an exclusive club soccer team, she may not want to play in the local league because she sees it as ""recreational activity"" rather than a real sport. This can create a situation in which most people are physically inactive at the same time that a small number of people perform at relatively high levels for large numbers of fans ― a situation that negatively impacts health and increases health-care costs in a society or community.

They found that the respondents' suggestions changed significantly depending on whether the metaphor used to describe crime was as a virus or as a beast.

Being a hardworking scholar, he held academic positions in several universities in England. He also wrote many books on psychology including the well-known Introduction to Social Psychology. In 1920, he published The Group Mind opposing mechanistic interpretations of human behavior. However, The Group Mind was poorly received when published. Somewhat disappointed, he moved to the United States in the same year to be a professor at Harvard University. Seven years later, he moved to Duke University, where he developed a psychology department and continued various research.

In strict Darwinism the prime mover is environmental threat. In the absence of threat, natural selection tends to resist change. It is un-biological to ""explain"" behavioural change as resulting from genetic change or the ex vacuo emergence of domain-specific brain modules. Evolutionary psychologists surely know why brains evolved: as Cosmides and Tooby point out, brains are found only in animals that move. Brains are behavioural organs, and behavioural adaptation, being immediate and non-random, is vastly more efficient than genetic adaptation. So, in animals with brains, behavioural change is the usual first response to environmental threat. If the change is successful, genetic adaptation to the new behaviour will follow more gradually. Animals do not evolve carnivore teeth and then decide it might be a good idea to eat meat."

Eventually they lose focus, become distracted, and check out, leaving the system to run on its own.

Of course, most accomplished musicians can play compositions containing many thousands of notes entirely from memory, without a note out of place. But this seemingly awesome accomplishment of recall is made probable by remembering the musical process, not the individual notes as such. If you ask a pianist to start a Mozart sonata from bar forty-one, she'll probably have to mentally replay the music from the start until reaching that bar ― the score is not simply laid out in her mind, to be read from any random point. It's rather like describing how you drive to work: you don't simply recite the names of roads as an abstract list, but have to construct your route by mentally retracing it.

As a result, researchers gradually began to believe that runners are subconsciously able to adjust leg stiffness prior to foot strike based on their perceptions of the hardness or stiffness of the surface on which they are running. This view suggests that runners create soft legs that soak up impact forces when they are running on very hard surfaces and stiff legs when they are moving along on yielding terrain. As a result, impact forces passing through the legs are strikingly similar over a wide range of running surface types. Contrary to popular belief, running on concrete is not more damaging to the legs than running on soft sand."

Tomatoes and other fruits are, therefore, usually picked and transported when they are unripe. In some countries they are then sprayed with ethylene before sale to the consumer to induce ripening. However, fruit picked before it is ripe has less flavour than fruit picked ripe from the plant. Biotechnologists therefore saw an opportunity in delaying the ripening and softening process in fruit. If ripening could be slowed down by interfering with ethylene production or with the processes that respond to ethylene, fruit could be left on the plant until it was ripe and full of flavour but would still be in good condition when it arrived at the supermarket shelf."

During the first night, all the bats captured at least one firefly. But by the fourth night, most bats had learned to avoid fireflies and catch all the other prey instead. When the team painted fireflies' light organs dark, a new set of bats took twice as long to learn to avoid them. It had long been thought that firefly bioluminescence mainly acted as a mating signal, but the new finding explains why firefly larvae also glow despite being immature for mating."

However, through state land reforms and the development of additional sources of supply, water rights have become separated from land, and may be sold at auction. This therefore favours those who can pay, rather than ensuring access to all in the community. The situation arises, therefore, where individuals may hold land with no water. In Peru, the government grants water to communities separately from land, and it is up to the community to allocate it. Likewise in Yemen, the traditional allocation was one measure (tasah) of water to one hundred 'libnah' of land. This applied only to traditional irrigation supplies ― from runoff, wells, etc., where a supply was guaranteed. Water derived from the capture of flash floods is not subject to Islamic law as this constitutes an uncertain source, and is therefore free for those able to collect and use it. However, this traditional allocation per unit of land has been bypassed, partly by the development of new supplies, but also by the increase in cultivation of a crop of substantial economic importance. This crop is harvested throughout the year and thus requires more than its fair share of water. The economic status of the crop ensures that water rights can be bought or bribed away from subsistence crops."

It is no doubt true that many people are motivated to carry out creative activities because of problems they sense in their personal or professional environments. However, there is historical evidence that the creative process can be set in motion without necessity, even in the domain of invention. As one example, consider the invention of the airplane. At the end of the nineteenth century a number of research projects were underway whose purpose was the invention of a flying machine. At that time, there was no need for such a machine; only gradually, after the Wright brothers were successful in inventing the airplane, did the broader implications of that invention become apparent. So the driving force behind the invention of the airplane seems not to have been necessity: There was no need to fly; people simply wanted to."

I believe that stories ― not the ones people tell us but the ones we tell ourselves ― determine nothing less than our personal and professional destinies. And the most important story you will ever tell about yourself is the story you tell to yourself. So, you'd better examine your story, especially this one that's supposedly the most familiar of all. ""The most erroneous stories are those we think we know best ― and therefore never scrutinize or question,"" said paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. Participate in your story rather than observing it from afar; make sure it's a story that compels you. Tell yourself the right story ― the rightness of which only you can really determine. If you're finally living the story you want, then it needn't ― it shouldn't and won't ― be an ordinary one. It can and will be extraordinary.

Rather than face the stress of turning the pet in to a shelter, owners drive pets far from their home range and abandon them. Some people believe the animal has a better chance to survive roaming free than at a shelter, a false belief formed to salve the pet abandoner's conscience. Releasing your pet, whether a cat, rabbit, or bearded dragon, is not the answer. Typically, people report roaming dogs for pickup by animal control authorities, who take the dog to the local shelter. Cats and exotic or unusual animals, unless confined to a small area, are not usually discovered or reported. Released pets not captured and sheltered suffer from weather, wild predators, and a lack of adequate food. Some pets die a difficult death. Other released pets survive and breed successfully.

Difference between people and places may be socially constructed through the erection of boundaries, but this does not mean that it is not deeply internalized by the members of a society.

Our ability to stand high on a ladder above our normal thinking processes and evaluate why we are thinking as we are thinking is an evolutionary marvel. We have this ability because the most recently developed part of the human brain ― the prefrontal cortex ― enables self-reflective, abstract thought. We can think about ourselves as if we are not part of ourselves. Research on primate behavior indicates that even our closest cousins, the chimpanzees, lack this ability (although they possess some self-reflective abilities, like being able to identify themselves in a mirror instead of thinking the reflection is another chimp). The ability is a double-edged sword, because while it allows us to evaluate why we are thinking what we are thinking, it also puts us in touch with difficult existential questions that can easily become obsessions."

From 1905, he began a long collaboration with fellow Hungarian Zoltán Kodály in trying to popularize Hungarian folk songs and gained a practical knowledge of string writing from both folk and classical musicians. Bartók had a successful career as a pianist, performing throughout Europe and in the United States with musicians such as the jazz clarinetist Benny Goodman.

For example, in a recent study of the Mlabri, a modern hunter-gatherer group from northern Thailand, it was found that these people had previously been farmers, but had abandoned agriculture about 500 years ago. This raises the interesting question as to how many of the diminishing band of contemporary hunter-gatherer cultures are in fact the descendents of farmers who have only secondarily readopted hunter-gathering as a more useful lifestyle, perhaps after suffering from crop failures, dietary deficiencies, or climatic changes. Therefore, the process of what may be termed the 'agriculturalization' of human societies was not necessarily irreversible, at least on a local level. Hunter-gatherer cultures across the world, from midwestern Amerindians to !Kung in the African Kalahari, have adopted and subsequently discarded agriculture, possibly on several occasions over their history, in response to factors such as game abundance, climatic change, and so on."

One of the positive features of interpersonal arguments is that they are comprised of exchanges between two people who feel powerful enough to set forth reasons for their beliefs.

Sugars are carbohydrates, which is to say that they are made of carbon (""carbo-""), hydrogen (""hydr-""), and oxygen (""-ate"") atoms. When heated, these long molecules disintegrate into smaller units, some of which are so small that they evaporate (which accounts for the lovely smell). On the whole, it is the carbon-rich molecules that are larger, so these get left behind, and within these there is a structure called a carbon-carbon double bond. This chemical structure absorbs light. In small amounts it gives the caramelizing sugar a yellow-brown color. Further roasting will turn some of the sugar into pure carbon (double bonds all round), which creates a burnt flavor and a dark-brown color. Complete roasting results in charcoal: all of the sugar has become carbon, which is black."

That is because when you recall a real memory, you begin to reexperience some of the emotion from that event. As a result, that emotion feels obvious to you (and would be obvious to anyone watching you). If you are lying, though, you don't really experience that emotion, so you describe it instead.

Some theorists view it as a body of knowledge that developed to provide accurate information to people that helps them adjust to the many demands of life, whether that means obtaining food and shelter, defending against rival outgroups, and so on. Culture also tells us how groups of people work together to achieve mutually beneficial goals, and how to live our lives so that others will like and accept us ― and maybe even fall in love with us. So if adaptation to physical and social environments were all that cultures were designed to facilitate, perhaps cultures would always strive toward an accurate understanding of the world. However, adaptation to the metaphysical environment suggests that people do not live by truth and accuracy alone. Sometimes it is more adaptive for cultural worldviews to distort the truth about life and our role in it. Some things about life are too emotionally devastating to face head on, such as the inevitability of death. Because overwhelming fear can get in the way of many types of adaptive action, it sometimes is adaptive for cultures to provide ""rose-colored glasses"" with which to understand reality and our place in it. From the existential perspective, the adaptive utility of accurate worldviews is tempered by the adaptive value of anxiety-buffering illusions."

I mentally recalled some of my own journeys with wiggly ones on my lap, especially the day my own toddler cried the entire trip from Chicago to Florida, which was something of a nightmare. At least neither of these children was crying or being difficult. The sleeping baby seemed to get heavier as time went on. The book I had planned to read remained in my bag under the seat. Sleepiness overtook me for a short while. Then we could see the snow on Mt. Hood, and I knew the flight would soon end. Finally the wiggly one slept. The baby sister had slept all the way across the country. Now she opened her big blue eyes and smiled at me, unafraid. Then it was my turn to play little games with her. How easy it was to entertain this contented baby! I offered to help the children into their stroller on the jet way, but the mother assured she could manage quite well on her own.

I am currently looking for a place for this year’s contest exhibition. The Caroline County Art Contest has had over one hundred artworks submitted to us by local artists. For the theme, we wanted artists to explore the natural world of Caroline County. I believe the Garden Café Gallery would be a perfect place to host the event, as your gallery is well-known for its beautiful garden. The exhibition is usually held throughout October, and we very much hope that we can rent a space for the exhibition at the Garden Café Gallery during this time. I look forward to your response. Yours sincerely, Sophia Willis"

Originally born in France, Brunel escaped to the United States during the French Revolution. He later moved to London. When the Napoleonic Wars were at their height, he invented machines for making boots. During the Napoleonic Wars, Brunel's factory supplied British troops with boots. After the Wars ended, however, the government stopped buying his boots and he went out of business. A few years later, Brunel was imprisoned for several months because of his debt. At that time, London was very much divided by the River Thames and needed more ways for people and goods to move across it. In 1825, Brunel designed a tunnel under the river. The Thames Tunnel officially opened on 25 March 1843, and Brunel, despite being in ill health, attended the opening ceremony."

Social and cultural influences and causes are minimized, ignored, or eliminated from consideration at all. Thoughts, original and conventional, are identified with individuals, and the special things that individuals are and do are traced to their genes and their brains. The “trick” here is to recognize that individual humans are social constructions themselves, embodying and reflecting the variety of social and cultural influences they have been exposed to during their lives. Our individuality is not denied, but it is viewed as a product of specific social and cultural experiences. The brain itself is a social thing, influenced structurally and at the level of its connectivities by social environments. The “individual” is a legal, religious, and political fiction just as the “I” is a grammatical illusion."

We realize now that this is, and always was, impossible. We know within limits, not absolutely, even if the limits can usually be adjusted to satisfy our needs. Curiously, from this new level of uncertainty even greater goals emerge and appear to be attainable. Even if we cannot know the world with absolute precision, we can still control it.

The provision of timely, constructive feedback to participants on performance is an asset that some competitions and contests offer. In a sense, all competitions give feedback. For many, this is restricted to information about whether the participant is an award- or prizewinner. The provision of that type of feedback can be interpreted as shifting the emphasis to demonstrating superior performance but not necessarily excellence. The best competitions promote excellence, not just winning or ""beating"" others. The emphasis on superiority is what we typically see as fostering a detrimental effect of competition. Performance feedback requires that the program go beyond the ""win, place, or show"" level of feedback. Information about performance can be very helpful, not only to the participant who does not win or place but also to those who do."

In this way, 'thought suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to suppress instead of calming them'. One common example of this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food often begin to think much more about food. This process is therefore also known as the rebound effect. The ironic effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related cognitive processes. This dual-process system involves, first, an intentional operating process, which consciously attempts to locate thoughts unrelated to the suppressed ones. Second, and simultaneously, an unconscious monitoring process tests whether the operating system is functioning effectively. If the monitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the intended ones, it prompts the intentional operating process to ensure that these are replaced by appropriate thoughts. However, it is argued, the intentional operating system can fail due to increased cognitive load caused by fatigue, stress and emotional factors, and so the monitoring process filters the inappropriate thoughts into consciousness, making them highly accessible."

In other words, they are valued because of their market potential. Residents develop an identity in part based on how the landscape can generate income for the community. This process involves more than the conversion of the natural elements into commodities. The landscape itself, including the people and their sense of self, takes on the form of a commodity. Over time, the landscape identity can evolve into a sort of ""logo"" that can be used to sell the stories of the landscape. Thus, California's ""Wine Country,"" Florida's ""Sun Coast,"" or South Dakota's ""Badlands"" shape how both outsiders and residents perceive a place, and these labels build a set of expectations associated with the culture of those who live there."

However, humans have been replacing diverse natural habitats with artificial monoculture for millennia. Most natural habitats in the advanced nations have already been replaced with some form of artificial environment based on mass production or repetition. The real threat to biodiversity is surely the need to convert ever more of our planet into production zones to feed the ever-increasing human population. The cloning and transgenic alteration of domestic animals makes little difference to the overall situation. Conversely, the renewed interest in genetics has led to a growing awareness that there are many wild plants and animals with interesting or useful genetic properties that could be used for a variety of as-yet-unknown purposes. This has led in turn to a realization that we should avoid destroying natural ecosystems because they may harbor tomorrow's drugs against cancer, malaria, or obesity."

Such a view, which grounds equality not in human uniformity but in the interplay of uniformity and difference, builds difference into the very concept of equality, breaks the traditional equation of equality with similarity, and is immune to monist distortion. Once the basis of equality changes so does its content. Equality involves equal freedom or opportunity to be different, and treating human beings equally requires us to take into account both their similarities and differences. When the latter are not relevant, equality entails uniform or identical treatment; when they are, it requires differential treatment. Equal rights do not mean identical rights, for individuals with different cultural backgrounds and needs might require different rights to enjoy equality in respect of whatever happens to be the content of their rights. Equality involves not just rejection of irrelevant differences as is commonly argued, but also full recognition of legitimate and relevant ones."

It is a process. In the protopian mode, things are better today than they were yesterday, although only a little better. It is incremental improvement or mild progress. The ""pro"" in protopian stems from the notions of process and progress. This subtle progress is not dramatic, not exciting. It is easy to miss because a protopia generates almost as many new problems as new benefits. The problems of today were caused by yesterday's technological successes, and the technological solutions to today's problems will cause the problems of tomorrow. This circular expansion of both problems and solutions hides a steady accumulation of small net benefits over time.

A large majority of people wanted society to 'move away from greed and excess toward a way of life more centred on values, community, and family'. But they also felt that these priorities were not shared by most of their fellow Americans, who, they believed, had become 'increasingly atomized, selfish, and irresponsible'. As a result they often felt isolated. However, the report says, that when brought together in focus groups to discuss these issues, people were 'surprised and excited to find that others share[d] their views'. Rather than uniting us with others in a common cause, the unease we feel about the loss of social values and the way we are drawn into the pursuit of material gain is often experienced as if it were a purely private ambivalence which cuts us off from others."

This means you often must work longer and later into the evening, arrive home later, go to bed later, and need to wake up earlier, creating a negative feedback loop. Why try to boil a pot of water on medium heat when you could do so in half the time on high? People often tell me that they do not have enough time to sleep because they have so much work to do. Without wanting to be combative in any way whatsoever, I respond by informing them that perhaps the reason they still have so much to do at the end of the day is precisely because they do not get enough sleep at night."

A good idea－a real breakthrough－will often go unnoticed at the time and may only later be understood as having provided the basis for a substantial advance in AI, perhaps when someone reinvents it at a more convenient time. Ideas are tried out, initially on simple problems to show that the basic intuitions are correct and then on harder problems to see how well they scale up.

Jakobson taught in Czechoslovakia between the two world wars, where he was one of the leaders of the influential Prague Linguistic Circle. When Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Nazis, he was forced to flee to Scandinavia, and went from there to the United States in 1941. In 1943 he became one of the founding members of the Linguistic Circle of New York and acted as its vice president until 1949. He taught at numerous institutions from 1943 on, including Harvard University and MIT. Through his teaching in the United States, Jakobson helped to bridge the gap between European and American linguistics. Known as the father of modern structural linguistics, he elaborated sophisticated theories of language and communication that have had significant effects on such disciplines as anthropology, art criticism, and brain research."

Rules of evidence perform a similar function by affording accused persons fair opportunity to answer the charges against them, whilst at the same time respecting their right to remain silent if they choose to keep their counsel and put the prosecution to proof. These and other rules of criminal evidence and procedure treat the accused as thinking, feeling, human subjects of official concern and respect, who are entitled to be given the opportunity to play an active part in procedures with a direct and possibly catastrophic impact on their welfare."

For both activities, disciplining the body and mind is central to achieving what is typically considered a successful performance. Indeed one might assume that one of the prime objectives of art, as in sports, is to win recognition for the artist/performer's technical physical ability.

In contrast, members of individualist cultures tend to define themselves in terms of their independence from groups and autonomy and are socialized to value individual freedoms and individual expressions. In individualist cultures, standing out and being different is often seen as a sign of braveness.

Certainly not compared with Julius Caesar invading Britain, Genghis Khan sacking Baghdad and Christopher Columbus discovering America. That's how many people understand history. 'The history of the world is but the biography of great men,' wrote Thomas Carlyle. But the 'great man' theory of history has been on its way out for years.

Moving down to the level of time that occurs at 1/1000 of a second are biological constants with respect to the temporal resolution of our senses. If a sound has a gap in it shorter than 10 milliseconds, we will tend not to hear it, because of resolution limits of the auditory system. For a similar reason, a series of clicks ceases to sound like clicks and becomes a musical note when the clicks are presented at a rate of about once every 25 milliseconds. If you're flipping through static (still) pictures, they must be presented slower than about once every 40 milliseconds in order for you to see them as separate images.

So profound is the extent to which our sense of the world is shaped by media products today that, when we travel to distant parts of the world as a visitor or tourist, our lived experience is often preceded by a set of images and expectations acquired through extended exposure to media products.

The well-established U-shaped function of aerodynamic power requirement as a function of flight speed has wide applicability. It shows that for most birds, slow flight, even for short periods, is not possible and this becomes more acute for birds with high wing loading and consequently higher average flight speeds. In essence, birds cannot readily slow down. Sustained slow flight for a bird which has a high average flight speed is costly or aerodynamically impossible and, hence, being able to reduce speed in order to match the rate of gain of information to increasing perceptual challenges is unlikely to occur. In other words, when the environment restricts the information available (e.g. rain, mist, low light levels), birds cannot easily fly more slowly in order to compensate for lowered visibility. Thus if birds are to fly under non-ideal perceptual conditions, or visibility conditions change during a flight, they cannot act in the way that a careful car driver can and reduce their speed in order to gain information at a rate sufficient to match the new perceptual challenge."

They worked with children who believed that the earth is flat (because this fit their experiences) and attempted to help them understand that, in fact, it is spherical. When told it is round, children often pictured the earth as a pancake rather than as a sphere. If they were then told that it is round like a sphere, they interpreted the new information about a spherical earth within their flat-earth view by picturing a pancake-like flat surface inside or on top of a sphere, with humans standing on top of the pancake. The model of the earth that they had developed — and that helped them explain how they could stand or walk upon its surface—did not fit the model of a spherical earth.

If risk is a continuum from high risk to low risk, a retired investor will generally take less risk than a young investor just entering the market. Why is this? Why are younger investors generally willing to take more risks than older investors? It is not because younger people don't care or tend to make hazardous decisions, although that may be true to some extent. No, younger investors tend to take more risk with their investments because they have a longer time horizon on when they expect to actually need their money. For the vast majority of people, the reason they invest is so they can enjoy retirement. This means that younger people are not expecting to sell their investments for twenty or thirty years. With this kind of time horizon, they can afford to shoot for the higher risk, higher return investments. For them, the prospect of losing money is not that bad.

This sometimes leads to what psychologists call malignant envy, the desire for someone to meet with misfortune (“I wish she didn’t have what she has”). Also, comparing ourselves with someone who’s doing worse than we are risks scorn, the feeling that others are something undeserving of our beneficence (“She’s beneath my notice”).

Since the Neanderthals had already become acclimatized to cold conditions for at least 200,000 years in Europe, it may seem counterintuitive that they lost out to the new arrivals, who were not only unaccustomed to cold climate but who came from a subtropical African climate, via the Near East. It appears that the technological superiority of Homo sapiens played a role. The population of the new arrivals increased tenfold as the population of the existing Neanderthals decreased. At least one researcher has speculated that the ability of the new arrivals to produce more advanced clothing involving closely fitting skins was significant. This presumably required sewing hides together, possibly in double layers, and fastening them with buttons or pegs, allowing the wearer to hunt in colder conditions. In contrast, the Neanderthals may have had only a single layer or wrap-around clothing, which did not involve sophisticated tailoring or sewing."

These constraints may be helpful to facilitate agreement, as they put pressure on parties to come to agreement. But they also bound the negotiation and prevent the parties from spelling out a complete set of arrangements, and so the constitutional bargain will of necessity be incomplete.

The proverb is about power, control and law making. Environmental journalists have to play the role of the 'lion's historians'. They have to put across the point of view of the environment to people who make the laws. They have to be the voice of wild India. The present rate of human consumption is completely unsustainable. Forest, wetlands, wastelands, coastal zones, eco-sensitive zones, they are all seen as disposable for the accelerating demands of human population. But to ask for any change in human behaviour ― whether it be to cut down on consumption, alter lifestyles or decrease population growth ― is seen as a violation of human rights. But at some point human rights become 'wrongs'. It's time we changed our thinking so that there is no difference between the rights of humans and the rights of the rest of the environment."

After obtaining his Ph.D. in 1916 at Cornell University, Knight taught at Cornell, the University of Iowa, and the University of Chicago. Knight spent most of his career at the University of Chicago. Some of his students at Chicago later received the Nobel Prize. Knight is known as the author of the book Risk, Uncertainty and Profit, a study of the role of the entrepreneur in economic life. He also wrote a brief introduction to economics entitled The Economic Organization, which became a classic of microeconomic theory. But Knight was much more than an economist; he was also a social philosopher. Later in his career, Knight developed his theories of freedom, democracy, and ethics. After retiring in 1952, Knight remained active in teaching and writing."

Subjects must give their informed, written consent, and experimenters must submit their proposed experiments to thorough examination by overseeing bodies. Scientists who experiment on themselves can, functionally if not legally, avoid the restrictions associated with experimenting on other people. They can also sidestep most of the ethical issues involved: nobody, presumably, is more aware of an experiment's potential hazards than the scientist who devised it. Nonetheless, experimenting on oneself remains deeply problematic. One obvious drawback is the danger involved; knowing that it exists does nothing to reduce it. A less obvious drawback is the limited range of data that the experiment can generate. Human anatomy and physiology vary, in small but significant ways, according to gender, age, lifestyle, and other factors. Experimental results derived from a single subject are, therefore, of limited value; there is no way to know whether the subject's responses are typical or atypical of the response of humans as a group."

Because this speed is the basis of the theory of relativity, it's one of the most frequently and carefully measured quantities in science. As far as we know, the speed hasn't changed over time. However, from 1870 to 1900, all the experiments found speeds that were too high. Then, from 1900 to 1950, the opposite happened - all the experiments found speeds that were too low! This kind of error, where results are always on one side of the real value, is called ""bias."" It probably happened because over time, experimenters subconsciously adjusted their results to match what they expected to find. If a result fit what they expected, they kept it. If a result didn't fit, they threw it out. They weren't being intentionally dishonest, just influenced by the conventional wisdom. The pattern only changed when someone had the courage to report what was actually measured instead of what was expected."

The discovery of administrative tablets from the temple complexes at Uruk suggests that token use and consequently writing evolved as a tool of centralized economic governance. Given the lack of archaeological evidence from Uruk-period domestic sites, it is not clear whether individuals also used the system for personal agreements. For that matter, it is not clear how widespread literacy was at its beginnings. The use of identifiable symbols and pictograms on the early tablets is consistent with administrators needing a lexicon that was mutually intelligible by literate and nonliterate parties. As cuneiform script became more abstract, literacy must have become increasingly important to ensure one understood what he or she had agreed to."

Assessing the survivability of an environment can be risky (if an environment turns out to be deadly, for instance, it might be too late by the time you found out), so humans have evolved the desire to associate with similar individuals as a way to perform this function efficiently. This is especially useful to a species that lives in so many different sorts of environments. However, the carrying capacity of a given environment places a limit on this strategy. If resources are very limited, the individuals who live in a particular place cannot all do the exact same thing (for example, if there are few trees, people cannot all live in tree houses, or if mangoes are in short supply, people cannot all live solely on a diet of mangoes). A rational strategy would therefore sometimes be to avoid similar members of one's species."

One team told repeated stories about a dumpster fire, something that does not seem funny on its face, but the reactions of workers motivated to preserve safety sparked laughter as the stories were shared multiple times by multiple parties in the workplace.

This insight was famously captured by Clausewitz's most famous phrase, ""War is a mere continuation of politics by other means."" To be political, a political entity or a representative of a political entity, whatever its constitutional form, has to have an intention, a will. That intention has to be clearly expressed. And one side's will has to be transmitted to the enemy at some point during the confrontation (it does not have to be publicly communicated). A violent act and its larger political intention must also be attributed to one side at some point during the confrontation. History does not know of acts of war without eventual attribution."

Unfortunately many of them are not cost effective. This is a fundamental requirement for energy efficiency investment from an economic perspective. However, the calculation of such cost effectiveness is not easy: it is not simply a case of looking at private costs and comparing them to the reductions achieved. There are significant externalities to take into account and there are also macroeconomic effects. For instance, at the aggregate level, improving the level of national energy efficiency has positive effects on macroeconomic issues such as energy dependence, climate change, health, national competitiveness and reducing fuel poverty. And this has direct repercussions at the individual level: households can reduce the cost of electricity and gas bills, and improve their health and comfort, while companies can increase their competitiveness and their productivity. Finally, the market for energy efficiency could contribute to the economy through job and firms creation."

Pleasure and pain are like two sides of the same coin; they seem to work together and are heavily reliant on one another and keep balance. If you imagine pleasure and pain as the two opposite points on a scale, you can easily understand that as one of the two points rises, the other must correspondingly fall. We’ve all heard the expression, “No pain, no gain.” Well, according to psychiatrist Dr. Anna Lembke, there may be some truth to these words. She says that our attempts to escape being miserable are in fact making us even more miserable. This is because pain is actually an essential component of our ability to maintain a neutral state, and allowing it will in turn reset our internal scale back to balance."

Rather, it means that the complexity of the animal's behavior is not purely a product of its internal complexity. Herbert Simon's ""parable of the ant"" makes this point very clearly. Imagine an ant walking along a beach, and visualize tracking the trajectory of the ant as it moves. The trajectory would show a lot of twists and turns, and would be very irregular and complicated. One could then suppose that the ant had equally complicated internal navigational abilities, and work out what these were likely to be by analyzing the trajectory to infer the rules and mechanisms that could produce such a complex navigational path. The complexity of the trajectory, however, ""is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant."" In reality, the ant may be using a set of very simple rules: it is the interaction of these rules with the environment that actually produces the complex trajectory, not the ant alone. Put more generally, the parable of the ant illustrates that there is no necessary correlation between the complexity of an observed behavior and the complexity of the mechanism that produces it."

The idea of ""control' would be a bothersome one for many peoples, as for instance among many native peoples of Amazonia where all members of a community are fond of their personal autonomy and notably allergic to any obvious expression of control or coercion. The conception of political power as a coercive force, while it may be a Western fixation, is not a universal. It is very unusual for an Amazonian leader to give an order. If many peoples do not view political power as a coercive force, nor as the most valued domain, then the leap from 'the political' to 'domination' (as coercion), and from there to 'domination of women', is a shaky one. As Marilyn Strathern has remarked, the notions of 'the political' and 'political personhood' are cultural obsessions of our own, a bias long reflected in anthropological constructs."

Respondents’ recollections may be inaccurate, and their definitions of ‘sad’ could vary widely. But asking “How many times in the past year were you sad enough to call in sick to work?” prompts a concrete answer. Similarly, instead of asking people to rate how bad a procrastinator they are, ask, “How many of your utility bills are you currently late in paying, even though you can afford to pay them?” Questions that seek concrete responses help make abstract concepts clearer and ensure consistency from one study to the next."

Linguistic metaphors are passive, in the sense that the audience needs to choose to actively enter the world proposed by metaphor. In the Shakespearean metaphor ""time is a beggar,"" the audience is unlikely to understand the metaphor without cognitive effort and without further engaging Shakespeare's prose. Technological metaphors, on the other hand, are active (and often imposing) in the sense that they are realized in digital artifacts that are actively doing things, forcefully changing a user's meaning horizon. Technological creators cannot generally afford to require their potential audience to wonder how the metaphor works; normally the selling point is that the usefulness of the technology is obvious at first glance. Shakespeare, on the other hand, is beloved in part because the meaning of his works is not immediately obvious and requires some thought on the part of the audience."

As we lack the resources to compute answers independently, we distribute the computation across the population and solve the answer slowly, generation by generation. Then all we have to do is socially learn the right answers. You don't need to understand how your computer or toilet works; you just need to be able to use the interface and flush. All that needs to be transmitted is which button to push ─ essentially how to interact with technologies rather than how they work. And so instead of holding more information than we have mental capacity for and indeed need to know, we could dedicate our large brains to a small piece of a giant calculation. We understand things well enough to benefit from them, but all the while we are making small calculations that contribute to a larger whole. We are just doing our part in a larger computation for our societies' collective brains."

So to find one in full view in the shallows in daylight was a surprise for two Australian underwater photographers. Actually, what they saw at first was a flounder. It was only when they looked again that they saw a medium-sized octopus, with all eight of its arms folded and its two eyes staring upwards to create the illusion. An octopus has a big brain, excellent eyesight and the ability to change colour and pattern, and this one was using these assets to turn itself into a completely different creature. Many more of this species have been found since then, and there are now photographs of octopuses that could be said to be transforming into sea snakes. And while they mimic, they hunt ─ producing the spectacle of, say, a flounder suddenly developing an octopodian arm, sticking it down a hole and grabbing whatever's hiding there."

If the group valued us, we could count on support, resources, and probably a mate. If it didn't, we might get none of these merits. It was a matter of survival, physically and genetically. Over millions of years, the pressure selected for people who are sensitive to and skilled at maximizing their standing. The result was the development of a tendency to unconsciously monitor how other people in our community perceive us. We process that information in the form of self-esteem and such related emotions as pride, shame, or insecurity. These emotions compel us to do more of what makes our community value us and less of what doesn't. And, crucially, they are meant to make that motivation feel like it is coming from within. If we realized, on a conscious level, that we were responding to social pressure, our performance might come off as grudging or cynical, making it less persuasive."

However, there is a major problem with this explanation. This is because the imbalance of substances in the brain is a consequence of depression, not its cause. In other words, depression causes a decrease in brain substances such as serotonin and noradrenaline, not a decrease in brain substances causes depression. In this revised cause-and-effect, the key is to reframe depression as a problem of consciousness. Our consciousness is a more fundamental entity that goes beyond the functioning of the brain. The brain is no more than an organ of consciousness. If it is not consciousness itself, then the root cause of depression is also a distortion of our state of consciousness: a consciousness that has lost its sense of self and the meaning of life. Such a disease of consciousness may manifest itself in the form of depression."

However, psychology is different. It is the branch of science that is devoted to understanding people: how and why we act as we do; why we see things as we do; and how we interact with one another. The key word here is 'science.' Psychologists don't depend on opinions and hearsay, or the generally accepted views of society at the time, or even the considered opinions of deep thinkers. Instead, they look for evidence, to make sure that psychological ideas are firmly based, and not just derived from generally held beliefs or assumptions. In addition to this evidence-based approach, psychology deals with fundamental processes and principles that generate our rich cultural and social diversity, as well as those shared by all human beings. These are what modern psychology is all about."

In just a single cell, the number of possible interactions between different molecules is enormous. Such a system can only hope to be stable if only a smaller number of collective ways of being may emerge. For example, it is only a limited number of tissues and body shapes that may result from the development of a human embryo. In 1942, the biologist Conrad Waddington called this drastic narrowing of outcomes canalization. The organism may switch between a small number of well-defined possible states, but can't exist in random states in between them, rather as a ball in a rough landscape must roll to the bottom of one valley or another. We'll see that this is true also of health and disease: there are many causes of illness, but their manifestations at the physiological and symptomatic levels are often strikingly similar."

But when the temperature rises by three or four more degrees, hardly anyone will be able to feel isolated from its impacts. And so as climate change expands across the horizon, it may cease to be a story. Why watch or read climate fiction about the world you can see plainly out your own window? At the moment, stories illustrating global warming can still offer an escapist pleasure, even if that pleasure often comes in the form of horror.

There is no need for a water crisis, in other words, but we have one anyway, and aren’t doing much to address it. Some cities lose more water to leaks than they deliver to homes: even in the United States, leaks and theft account for an estimated loss of 16 percent of freshwater; in Brazil, the estimate is 40 percent.

Children assume, for instance, that pointy rocks are that way because they don't want you to sit on them. When we encounter something, we first need to determine what sort of thing it is. Inanimate objects and plants generally do not move and can be evaluated from physics alone. However, by attributing intention to animals and even objects, we are able to make fast decisions about the likely behaviour of that being. This was essential in our hunter-gatherer days to avoid being eaten by predators. The anthropologist Stewart Guthrie made the point that survival in our evolutionary past meant that we interpret ambiguous objects as agents with human mental characteristics, as those are the mental processes which we understand. Ambiguous events are caused by such agents. This results in a perceptual system strongly biased towards anthropomorphism. Therefore, we tend to assume intention even where there is none. This would have arisen as a survival mechanism. If a lion is about to attack you, you need to react quickly, given its probable intention to kill you. By the time you have realized that the design of its teeth and claws could kill you, you are dead. So, assuming intent, without detailed design analysis or understanding of the physics, has saved your life."

A trick-punishment is a scolding, a moment of anger or a punishment in the most classic sense of the word. Instead of discouraging the child from doing something, it encourages them to do it. For example, Hugh learns that when he hits his little brother, his mother scolds him. For a child who feels lonely, being scolded is much better than feeling invisible, so he will continue to hit his brother. In this case, his mother would be better adopting a different strategy. For instance, she could congratulate Hugh when he has not hit his brother for a certain length of time. The mother clearly cannot allow the child to hit his little brother, but instead of constantly pointing out the negatives, she can choose to reward the positives. In this way, any parent can avoid trick-punishments."

Similarly, the person who accepts exercise as the part of their identity doesn't have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy.

One is the route through which we perceive most external sounds, like waves that travel from the air through the outer, middle and inner ear.

The choice of whether the structure is ""mechanistic"" or ""organic"" can have a profound influence on conflict management.

Whales also help sequester carbon by fertilizing the ocean as they release nutrient-rich waste, in turn increasing phytoplankton populations, which also sequester carbon ― leading some scientists to call them the “engineers of marine ecosystems.” In 2019, economists from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated the value of the ecosystem services provided by each whale at over $2 million USD. They called for a new global program of economic incentives to return whale populations to preindustrial whaling levels as one example of a “nature-based solution” to climate change. Calls are now being made for a global whale restoration program, to slow down climate change."

During her childhood, with her father’s support, she was able to get mathematical and scientific education that most women of her time did not receive. In 1737, she submitted her paper on the nature of fire to a contest sponsored by the French Academy of Sciences, and it was published a year later. In her book, Institutions de Physique, Émilie du Châtelet explained the ideas of space and time in a way that is closer to what we understand in modern relativity than what was common during her time. Her most significant achievement was translating Isaac Newton’s Principia into French near the end of her life. Émilie du Châtelet’s work was not recognized in her time, but she is now remembered as a symbol of the Enlightenment and the struggle for women’s participation in science."

Some cities reserve an extensive network of lanes and streets for bikes, pedestrians, and the occasional service vehicle. This motivates people to travel by bike rather than by car, making streets safer for everyone. As bicycles become more popular in a city, planners can convert more automobile lanes and entire streets to accommodate more of them. Nevertheless, even the most bikeable cities still require motor vehicle lanes for taxis, emergency vehicles, and delivery trucks. Delivery vehicles are frequently a target of animus, but they are actually an essential component to making cities greener. A tightly packed delivery truck is a far more efficient transporter of goods than several hybrids carrying a few shopping bags each. Distributing food and other goods to neighborhood vendors allows them to operate smaller stores close to homes so that residents can walk, rather than drive, to get their groceries."

So when you start to watch television, before you absorb the message of any particular TV show ─ whether it's Wheel of Fortune or The Wire ─ you start to see the world as being shaped like television itself. That's why Marshall McLuhan said that every time a new medium comes along ─ a new way for humans to communicate ─ it has buried in it a message.

This statement beautifully sums up the search for essences. History has many examples of scientists who searched fruitlessly for an essence because they used the wrong concept to guide their hypotheses. Firestein gives the example of luminiferous ether, a mysterious substance that was thought to fill the universe so that light would have a medium to move through. The ether was a black cat, writes Firestein, and physicists had been theorizing in a dark room, and then experimenting in it, looking for evidence of a cat that did not exist."

Not unlike reality television stars, social media celebrities are often criticized for not having skills and talents associated with traditional, elite celebrity, such as acting or singing ability. This criticism highlights the fact that digital content creators face real barriers to crossing over to the sphere of elite celebrity. However, the criticism also misses the point that the phenomenon of ordinary celebrity reconstructs the meaning of fame. The elite celebrity is symbolized by the metaphor of the star, characterized by mystery and hierarchical distance and associated with naturalized qualities of talent and class. The ordinary celebrity attracts attention through regular and frequent interactions with other ordinary people. Achieving ordinary fame as a social media celebrity is like doing well at a game, because in this sphere, fame is nothing more nor less than relatively high scores on attention scales, the metrics of subscribers, followers, Likes, or clicks built into social media applications."

Such imitation is not perfect. You may not see the tongue stick out each time you stick yours out at your newborn, but if you do it many times, the tongue will come out more often than if you do something different.

""Homologous"" traits, in contrast, may or may not have a common function, but they descended from a common ancestor and hence have some common structure that indicates their being ""the same"" organ. The wing of a bat and the front leg of a horse have very different functions, but they are all modifications of the forelimb of the ancestor of all mammals. As a result, they share nonfunctional traits like the number of bones and the ways they are connected.

It has long been established in physics that cold water holds more dissolved oxygen than warm water does ― this is one reason that cold polar seas are full of life while tropical oceans are blue, clear, and relatively poorly populated with living creatures. Thus, as global warming raises the temperature of marine waters, it is self-evident that the amount of dissolved oxygen will decrease. This is a worrisome and potentially disastrous consequence if allowed to continue to an ecosystem-threatening level. Now scientists have analyzed data indicating that the amount of dissolved oxygen in the oceans has been declining for more than a half century. The data show that the ocean oxygen level has been falling more rapidly than the corresponding rise in water temperature. Falling oxygen levels in water have the potential to impact the habitat of marine organisms worldwide and in recent years this has led to more frequent anoxic events that killed or displaced populations of fish, crabs, and many other organisms."

Researchers train them to associate one place with an experience such as food or a loud noise and another place with something completely different, usually where nothing happens. The two places are made obviously different to make it as easy as possible for the animal to associate each place with what happened to it there. The animal's preference for being in one place or another is measured both before and after its experiences in the two places. If there is a shift in where the animal chooses to spend its time for the reward, this suggests that it liked the experience and is trying to repeat it. Conversely, if it now avoids the place the stimulus appeared and starts to prefer the place it did not experience it, then this suggests that it found the stimulus unpleasant. For example, mice with cancer show a preference for the place where they have been given morphine, a drug used to relieve pain, rather than where they have received saline whereas healthy mice developed no such preference. This suggests that the mice with cancer wanted the morphine."

But in temperate and polar regions, the breeding seasons of birds are often sharply defined. They are triggered mainly by changes in day length. If all goes well, the outcome is that birds raise their young when the food supply is at its peak. Most birds are not simply reluctant to breed at other times but they are also physically incapable of doing so. This is because their reproductive system shrinks, which helps flying birds save weight. The main exception to this rule are nomadic desert species. These can initiate their breeding cycle within days of rain. It's for making the most of the sudden breeding opportunity. Also, different species divide the breeding season up in different ways. Most seabirds raise a single brood. In warm regions, however, songbirds may raise several families in a few months. In an exceptionally good year, a pair of House Sparrows, a kind of songbird, can raise successive broods through a marathon reproductive effort."

Consequently, efforts to distinguish reading from nonreading are destined to fail because there is no agreement on what qualifies as reading in the first place. The more one tries to figure out where the border lies between reading and not-reading, the more edge cases will be found to stretch the term's flexible boundaries.

Another example of this principle is that we can detect 1 candle when it is lit in an otherwise dark room. But when 1 candle is lit in a room in which 100 candles are already burning, we may not notice the light from this candle. Therefore, the Just-noticeable difference (JND) varies as a function of the strength of the signals. For example, the JND is greater for very loud noises than it is for much more quiet sounds. When a sound is very weak, we can tell that another sound is louder, even if it is barely louder. When a sound is very loud, to tell that another sound is even louder, it has to be much louder.

Theorists have maintained that literature encourages solitary reading and reflection as the way to engage with the world and thus counters the social and political activities that might produce social change. At best it encourages detachment or appreciation of complexity, and at worst passivity and acceptance of what is. But on the other hand, literature has historically been seen as dangerous: it promotes the questioning of authority and social arrangements. Plato banned poets from his ideal republic because they could only do harm, and novels have long been credited with making people dissatisfied with their lives and eager for something new. By promoting identification across divisions of class, gender, and race, books may promote a fellowship that discourages struggle; but they may also produce a keen sense of injustice that makes progressive struggles possible. Historically, works of literature are credited with producing change: Uncle Tom's Cabin, a best-seller in its day, helped create a revulsion against slavery that made possible the American Civil War."

Hence, the only place where morality and moral liberty will begin to find an application begins in a place where a sovereign power, namely the state, emerges. Hobbes thus describes the state of nature as a circumstance in which man's life is ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"". It means when people live without a general power to control them all, they are indeed in a state of war. In other words, Hobbes, who accepted that human beings are not social and political beings in the state of nature, believes that without the power human beings in the state of nature are ""antisocial and rational based on their selfishness"". Moreover, since society is not a natural phenomenon and there is no natural force bringing people together, what will bring them together as a society is not mutual affection according to Hobbes. It is, rather, mutual fear of men's present and future that assembles them, since the cause of fear is a common drive among people in the state of nature."

Perfect is a great goal, but nobody gets there all the time. What matters is what we do when things get messy."" That made him feel a little better. ""You are saying I can fix this?"" ""Absolutely, try to deal with problems in a logical way,"" Jeremy said. Max thought for a moment. ""I guess.... I can do that by rescheduling tonight's baseball lesson."" Jeremy beamed. ""See?

If the manufacturer makes only one version of its product, people who bought it might have been willing to spend more money, so the company is losing some income. If the company offers two versions, one with more features and more expensive than the other, people will compare the two models and still buy the less expensive one. But if the company introduces a third model with even more features and more expensive than the other two, sales of the second model go up; many people like the features of the most expensive model, but not the price. The middle item has more features than the least expensive one, and it is less expensive than the fanciest model. They buy the middle item, unaware that they have been manipulated by the presence of the higher-priced item."

In a classic study, highly creative architects were more likely than their technically competent but less original peers to come from homes with plenty of friction. They often grew up in households that were “tense but secure,” as psychologist Robert Albert notes: “The creative person-to-be comes from a family that is anything but harmonious.” The parents weren’t physically or verbally abusive, but they didn’t shy away from conflict, either. Instead of telling their children to be seen but not heard, they encouraged them to stand up for themselves. The kids learned to dish it out—and take it. That’s exactly what happened to Wilbur and Orville Wright, who invented the airplane. When the Wright brothers said they thought together, what they really meant is that they fought together. When they were solving problems, they had arguments that lasted not just for hours but for weeks and months at a time. They didn’t have such ceaseless fights because they were angry. They kept quarreling because they enjoyed it and learned from the experience. “I like scrapping with Orv,” Wilbur reflected. As you’ll see, it was one of their most passionate and prolonged arguments that led them to rethink a critical assumption that had prevented humans from soaring through the skies."

Don't fear self-assessment because you're worried you might have to admit some things about yourself. The second half of Goethe's maxim is important too.

It makes us happy today but does nothing to make us richer tomorrow. Yes, money spent on a television keeps workers employed at the television factory. But if the same money were invested, it would create jobs somewhere else, say for scientists in a laboratory or workers on a construction site, while also making us richer in the long run. Think about college as an example. Sending students to college creates jobs for professors. Using the same money to buy fancy sports cars for high school graduates would create jobs for auto workers. The crucial difference between these scenarios is that a college education makes a young person more productive for the rest of his or her life; a sports car does not. Thus, college tuition is an investment; buying a sports car is consumption."

On the contrary, it’s creativity, speed, and keenness. In the industrial era, the goal was to minimize variation. But in creative companies today, maximizing variation is more essential. In these situations, the biggest risk isn’t making a mistake or losing consistency; it’s failing to attract top talent, to invent new products, or to change direction quickly when the environment shifts. Consistency and repeatability are more likely to suppress fresh thinking than to bring your company profit. A lot of little mistakes, while sometimes painful, help the organization learn quickly and are a critical part of the innovation cycle.

So important is communication during a disaster that normal social barriers are often lowered. We will talk to strangers in a way we would never consider normally. Even relatively low grade disruption of our life such as a fire drill or a very late train seems to give us the permission to break normal etiquette and talk to strangers. The more important an event to a particular public, the more detailed and urgent the requirement for news becomes. Without an authoritative source of facts, whether that is a newspaper or trusted broadcast station, rumours often run riot. Rumours start because people believe their group to be in danger and so, although the rumour is unproven, feel they should pass it on. For example, if a worker heard that their employer’s business was doing badly and people were going to be made redundant, they would pass that information on to colleagues."

Haldane, see science in a similar light ― as a historical activity that occurs in a particular time and place, and that needs to be understood within that context. Others, however, see science as a purely “objective” pursuit, uninfluenced by the cultural viewpoint and values of those who create it. In describing this view of science, philosopher Hugh Lacey speaks of the belief that there is an underlying order of the world which is simply there to be discovered ― the world of pure “fact” stripped of any link with value. The aim of science according to this view is to represent this world of pure “fact”, independently of any relationship it might bear contingently to human practices and experiences."

In this sense, mental development consists of internalizing social patterns and gradually becoming a responsible actor among other responsible actors. In Denmark, the age of criminal responsibility is 15 years, which means that we then say that people have developed sufficient mental maturity to be accountable for their actions at this point. And at the age of 18 people are given the right to vote and are thereby formally included in the basic democratic process. I do not know whether these age boundaries are optimal, but it is clear that mental development takes place at different rates for different individuals, and depends especially on the social and family environment they have been given.

With each person who grasped the solar system view, it became easier for the next person to do so. So it is with the notion that the world revolves around the human economy. This is slowly being replaced by the view that the economy is a part of the larger system of material flows that connect all living things. When this perspective shifts into place, it will be obvious that our economic well-being requires that we account for, and respond to, factors of ecological health. Unfortunately we do not have a century or two to make the change. By clarifying the nature of the old and new perspectives, and by identifying actions on which we might cooperate to move the process along, we can help accelerate the shift."

Whichever the case, it is believed that in time they became capable of spreading out from Africa, eventually to most of the world. This was probably because their physical characteristics changed. For instance, early hominids probably did not walk upright, but when they developed that ability, they could travel more efficiently. More important, perhaps, was their development of tool making. With tools, they could hunt other animals, so they could consume more protein and fat than their low-energy vegetarian diet would have provided. Not only their bodies but also their brains would have been changed with more energy. The brain needs lots of energy to grow.

Having adjusted the dimensions of these plates due to their diverse origins, he was able to analyse the constant elements in fashion features and to come up with a study that was neither intuitive nor approximate, but precise, mathematical and statistical. He reduced women's clothing to a certain number of features: length and size of the skirt, size and depth of the neckline, height of the waistline. He demonstrated unambiguously that fashion is a profoundly regular phenomenon which is not located at the level of annual variations but on the scale of history. For practically 300 years, women's dress was subject to a very precise periodic cycle: forms reach the furthest point in their variations every fifty years. If, at any one moment, skirts are at their longest, fifty years later they will be at their shortest; thus skirts become long again fifty years after being short and a hundred years after being long."

To share out those riches, almost all societies have settled upon the market mechanism, rewarding people in various ways for the work that they do and the things that they own. But rising inequality, itself often driven by technology, has started to put that mechanism under strain. Today, markets already provide immense rewards to some people but leave many others with very little. And now, technological unemployment threatens to become a more radical version of the same story, taking place in the particular market we rely upon the most: the labor market. As that market begins to break down, more and more people will be in danger of not receiving a share of society's prosperity at all."

Experiments show that skilled golfers and wine aficionados have a hard time describing their putting and tasting techniques ― even asking them to explain their approaches is enough to interfere with their performance, so they often stay on autopilot. When I first saw an elite diver do four and a half somersaults, I asked how he managed to spin so fast. His answer: ""Just go up in a ball.""

This would also be the efficient way to keep most nutrients, especially the most sensitive ones such as many vitamins and anti-oxidants. Milling of cereals is one of the most harsh processes which dramatically affect nutrient content. While grains are naturally very rich in micronutrients, anti-oxidants and fiber (i.e. in wholemeal flour or flakes), milling usually removes the vast majority of minerals, vitamins and fibers to raise white flour. Such a spoilage of key nutrients and fiber is no longer acceptable in the context of a sustainable diet aiming at an optimal nutrient density and health protection. In contrast, fermentation of various foodstuffs or germination of grains are traditional, locally accessible, low-energy and highly nutritious processes of sounded interest."

But the research evidence is paradoxical: In problem-solving groups, the participants who are considered the most competent and have the best ideas tend not to be the ones who are best liked. Why? One possibility is that, although we like to be around competent people, those who are too competent make us uncomfortable. They may seem unapproachable, distant, superhuman ― and make us look bad (and feel worse) by comparison. If this were true, we might like people more if they reveal some evidence of fallibility.

For example, people in close or extended proximity to others infected by a virus are themselves more likely to become infected, just as people are more likely to drink excessively when they spend more time in the company of heavy drinkers. But there are also important differences between the two types of contagion. One is that visibility promotes behavioral contagion but inhibits the spread of infectious diseases. Solar panels that are visible from the street, for instance, are more likely to stimulate neighboring installations. In contrast, we try to avoid others who are visibly ill. Another important difference is that whereas viral contagion is almost always a bad thing, behavioral contagion is sometimes negative ― as in the case of smoking ― but sometimes positive, as in the case of solar installations."

One curious fact is that animals that are hibernating also have periods of sleep. It comes as a surprise to most of us, but hibernation and sleep are not the same thing at all, at least not from a neurological and metabolic perspective. Hibernating is more like being anesthetized: the subject is unconscious but not actually asleep. So a hibernating animal needs to get a few hours of conventional sleep each day within the larger unconsciousness. A further surprise to most of us is that bears, the most famous of wintry sleepers, don't actually hibernate. Real hibernation involves profound unconsciousness and a dramatic fall in body temperature ― often to around 32 degrees Fahrenheit. By this definition, bears don't hibernate, because their body temperature stays near normal and they are easily awakened. Their winter sleeps are more accurately called a state of torpor."

The difficulties start in childhood, when parents - the first and most powerful authority figures - show children ""the way things are."" This is a necessary element of learning language and socialization, and certainly most things learned in early childhood are noncontroversial: the English alphabet starts with A and ends with Z, the numbers 1 through 10 come before the numbers 11 through 20, and so on. Children, however, will spontaneously question things that are quite obvious to adults and even to older kids. The word ""why?"" becomes a challenge, as in, ""Why is the sky blue?"" Answers such as ""because it just is"" or ""because I say so"" tell children that they must unquestioningly accept what authorities say ""just because,"" and children who persist in their questioning are likely to find themselves dismissed or yelled at for ""bothering"" adults with ""meaningless"" or ""unimportant"" questions. But these questions are in fact perfectly reasonable. Why is the sky blue? Many adults do not themselves know the answer. And who says the sky's color needs to be called ""blue,"" anyway? How do we know that what one person calls ""blue"" is the same color that another calls ""blue""? The scientific answers come from physics, but those are not the answers that children are seeking. They are trying to understand the world, and no matter how irritating the repeated questions may become to stressed and time-pressed parents, it is important to take them seriously to encourage kids to question authority to think for themselves."

Nor do the duties of rescue need to be matched by rights: we respond to a child drowning in a pond because of her plight, not her rights. A society that succeeds in generating many obligations can be more generous and harmonious than one relying only on rights. Obligations are to rights what taxation is to public spending ― the bit that is demanding. Western electorates have mostly learned that discussion of public spending must balance its benefits against how it would be financed. Otherwise, politicians promise higher spending during an election, and the post-election excess of spending over revenue is resolved by inflation. Just as new obligations are similar to extra revenue, so the creation of rights is similar to extra spending. The rights may well be appropriate, but this can only be determined by a public discussion of the corresponding obligations."

Returning to the game of chess, back in 1956, thirteen-year-old child prodigy Bobby Fischer made a pair of remarkably creative moves against grandmaster Donald Byrne. First he sacrificed his knight, seemingly for no gain, and then exposed his queen to capture. On the surface, these moves seemed insane, but several moves later, Fischer used these moves to win the game. His creativity was praised at the time as the mark of genius. Yet today if you program that same position into an ordinary chess program, it will immediately suggest the exact moves that Fischer made. It's not because the computer has memorized the Fischer-Byrne game, but rather because it searches far enough ahead to see that these moves really do pay off."

The payoff of many traits changed, and so did optimal life strategy. For example, when humans hunted big game 100,000 years ago, they relied on close-in attacks with thrusting spears. Such attacks were highly dangerous and physically demanding, so in those days, hunters had to be heavily muscled and have thick bones. That kind of body had its disadvantages ― if nothing else, it required more food ― but on the whole, it was the best solution in that situation. But new weapons like the atlatl (a spearthrower) and the bow effectively stored muscle-generated energy, which meant that hunters could kill big game without big biceps and robust skeletons. Once that happened, lightly built people, who were better runners and did not need as much food, became competitively superior.

A study of Stanford University alumni found that those “who have varied work and educational backgrounds are much more likely to start their own businesses than those who have focused on one role at work or concentrated in one subject at school.” To cultivate an entrepreneurial culture, colleges and universities need to offer students a broad choice of experiences and wide exposure to different ideas.

Exposing young children to the world’s musical cultures brings them into the cultural conversation, allowing them to learn about self and others in an artistically meaningful and engaging way.

When we fail to make that choice and allow ourselves to be frequently sidetracked, we end up in “the confused, dazed, scatterbrained state” that James said is the opposite of attention. Staying on one road got much harder when the internet arrived and moved much of our reading online. Every hyperlink is an off-ramp, calling us to abandon the choice we made moments earlier. Nicholas Carr, in his 2010 book, grieved his lost ability to stay on one path. Life on the internet changed how his brain sought out information, even when he was off-line trying to read a book. It reduced his ability to focus and reflect because he now craved a constant stream of stimulation: “Once I was a scuba diver in the sea of words.

Aesthetic value and the notion of artistic beauty are important considerations, but they are not what motivates archival preservation in the first instance. The best archival decisions about art do not focus on territoriality (this object belongs in my institution even though I do not have the resources to care for it) or on questions of monetary value or prestige (this object raises the cultural standing of my institution).

Her father, who was an artist, took her to see the stone tools being studied by French prehistorians. This sparked her interest in archaeology. When she was just 17 years old, she served as an illustrator at a dig in England. Shortly after marrying Louis Leakey, she left for East Africa with her husband. Together, they made important fossil discoveries. In 1948, Mary found a partial skull fossil of Proconsul africanus on Rusinga Island in Lake Victoria. In 1959 in Tanzania, she discovered the skull of an early hominin that her husband named Zinjanthropus boisei, which is now known as Paranthropus boisei. Even after her husband’s death in 1972, Mary continued her work in Africa. Mary died in 1996, in Nairobi, Kenya."

When wild places are designated as wilderness, they are closed to most commercial activities and residential or infrastructure development. There is thus frequently an economic cost to wilderness preservation. Some critics claim that when wilderness and economic interests clash, economic interests should normally prevail. This argument, even if it is sound, won't exclude all wilderness preservation efforts, because some wilderness areas have little economic value. But a deeper problem with the argument is that it views nature from a human-focused and excessively economic point of view. Allowing economic considerations to outweigh all other forms of value is inconsistent with the biocentric reasons that support wilderness preservation. Thus, while it certainly makes sense to weigh the economic costs of wilderness protection, especially when such costs are high, the biocentric values underlying wilderness preservation exclude viewing economic considerations as the most important."

Adenosine binds with receptors on nerve cells, or neurons, slowing down their activity and making you feel drowsy. But caffeine is also able to bind with these receptors, and by doing so it blocks adenosine's effect, making your neurons fire more and keeping you alert. Caffeine also activates a gland at the base of your brain. This releases hormones that tell the adrenal glands on your kidneys to produce adrenaline, causing your heart to beat faster and your blood pressure to rise. If, however, your daily caffeine intake is consistent, your brain will adapt to it. Your brain is like, 'Okay, every morning I'm getting this caffeine that's binding to these receptors and blocking adenosine from binding to them.' So your brain creates extra receptors to give adenosine more of an opportunity to bind with them and have its usual effect. And more adenosine is also produced to counteract the caffeine. That's why it takes more and more caffeine to have the same effect."

Small amounts of water do not indicate the color of these large bodies of water; when pure drinking water is examined in a glass, it appears clear and colorless. Apparently a relatively large volume of water is required to reveal the blue color. Why is this so? When light penetrates water, it experiences both absorption and scattering. Water molecules strongly absorb infrared and, to a lesser degree, red light. At the same time, water molecules are small enough to scatter shorter wavelengths, giving water its blue-green color. The amount of long-wavelength absorption is a function of depth; the deeper the water, the more red light is absorbed. At a depth of 15m, the intensity of red light drops to 25% of its original value and falls to zero beyond a depth of 30m. Any object viewed at this depth is seen in a blue-green light. For this reason, red inhabitants of the sea, such as lobsters and crabs, appear black to divers not carrying a lamp."

Imagine that in its hourly struggle to survive over long periods of time and many generations, a fungus species might acquire a protective capsule ― a bit of coating ― that shields it or even masks it from other microbes or cells. Then it acquires some enzymes that enable it to survive whatever chemicals other microbes might throw at it. If it can overcome these chemicals, it may also overcome the same or similar chemicals used as antifungal drugs. Maybe it also evolves to tolerate warmer temperatures. Now we've got a yeast that once made its home in an apple tree or in a wetland but that at this point can live quite happily in our body, hide from our immune system, and disarm our drugs.

For this reason, inaccuracies often hide the full picture of what happened. For example, a company might decide to hire a consultant to assist with a major project. During this project, the consultant demonstrated some personality traits that clashed with a couple of the executives involved. Through the course of the project, they were able to put aside the personality conflicts in order to see their vision become a reality. Ultimately, the project was a success, enabling the company to move forward and profit. At a later date, the company, remembering the previous success, expressed an interest in hiring the same consultant for another large project. The executives who struggled with his personality last time may most vividly remember their difficulty in overcoming his personality and related emotions. In this case, the success of the project fades into the background as they focus on their previous experience, colored by their feelings of discomfort.

While these were passed in ancient Greece and Rome, and examples can be found in ancient China and Japan, they found their fullest expressions in Europe from the mid-twelfth century, before slowly disappearing in the early modern period. Such laws could touch on anything from diet to dress and furnishings, and sought to enforce social boundaries by encoding the social classes into a clear visual system: the peasants, in other words, should eat and dress like peasants; craftsmen should eat and dress like craftsmen. Color was a vital signifier in this social language ― dull, earthy colors like russet were explicitly confined to the poorest rural peasants, while bright ones like scarlet were the preserve of a select few."

Peripersonal space includes whatever is in arm's reach; things you can control right now by using your hands. This is the world of what's real, right now. Extrapersonal space refers to everything else ― whatever you can't touch unless you move beyond your arm's reach, whether it's three feet or three million miles away. This is the realm of possibility. With those definitions in place, another fact follows, obvious but useful: any interaction in the extrapersonal space must occur in the future. Or, to put it another way, distance is linked to time. For instance, if you're in the mood for a peach, but the closest one is sitting in a bin at the corner market, you can't enjoy it now. You can only enjoy it in the future, after you go get it."

Psychologist Wendy Mendes asked White and Asian college students to interact with Latino students who had been hired as actors by the researchers. Some of the Latino students portrayed themselves as socioeconomically “high status,” with lawyer fathers, professor mothers, and summers spent volunteering in Europe. Others portrayed themselves as “low status,” with unemployed parents and part-time summer jobs. The researchers found that when participants interacted with the Latino students who appeared to come from wealth and thus challenged American stereotypes, they responded physiologically as if to a threat: their blood vessels constricted and their heart activity changed. In these interactions, participants also saw the students who violated stereotypes as less likable. In this way, stereotypes that are descriptive can easily become prescriptive. The phenomenon, it turns out, may have a neuroscientific explanation: it’s an angry protest from the brain’s reward system."

In contrast, the anglerfish hopes its prey will notice and be lured toward its rod-like bioluminescent barbel; its fierce jaws stay hidden in the shadows. Bioluminescence is also used to frustrate predators. A species from the spookfish family relies on a bellyful of symbiotic, glowing bacteria to save it from becoming a meal. It uses the same concept developed by the US Navy during World War II to make bomber aircraft difficult to see. Just as Project Yehudi designed planes with under-wing spotlights, the fish's glowing belly conceals its silhouette against sunlight to hide it from watching eyes below.

History has had many successful rulers and conquerors who have got rid of entire populations, and even beyond that, our species has wiped out plenty of similar humanoid lines that existed on this earth. Scientific finds have so far discovered a number of other humanoid species that once shared the earth with us, some of which include Neanderthals and Denisovans.

The thalamus decides which sensory signals are allowed through its gate, and which are not. Should they be granted its permission to pass, they are sent to the cortex at the top of your brain, where they are consciously perceived. By locking its gates shut, the thalamus imposes a sensory blackout in the brain, preventing onward travel of those signals to the cortex.

In ethics, appeals to compassion and empathy can and should be part of rational arguments about ethical decisions. Moreover, the best practices of objectivity often combine partiality and impartiality. In a trial, the partiality of the prosecutor and the defense attorney (and the parties they represent) occurs within a larger impartial context. A judge or jury puts partial arguments to the test of objective evidence and to the impartial rules of law. Ideally, what is fair and objective emerges during a trial where partialities make their case and are judged by objective norms. The norms of objectivity were constructed not because their creators thought most humans could be 'empty' of bias. The reverse is true: the norms were constructed because of an acute awareness of human bias, because it is evident. Rather than conclude that objectivity is impossible because bias is universal, scientists, journalists, and others concluded the opposite: we biased humans need the discipline of objectivity to reduce the ineliminable presence of bias."

Light that manages to miss the retina exits the eye and creates that ghostly glow. When cats' light-gathering ability is combined with the very large population of rods in their eyes, the result is a predator that can see exceptionally well in the dark. Cats 'pay' for this nighttime accuracy with less accurate daytime vision and an inability to focus on close objects. This may seem counterproductive; what is the point of seeing a mouse in the dark if, in that final, close moment, the cat can't focus on it? Tactile information comes into play at this time; cats can move their whiskers forward and use them to get information about objects within the grasp of their jaws.

He then taught at the Vienna School of Arts and Crafts from 1919 to 1925. He founded an interior design firm together with some architect colleagues in 1925. He was one of early Vienna modernism’s most important figures, but already in the beginning of the 1920s he started to question modernism’s growing pragmatism. He had little appreciation for the French architect Le Corbusier’s belief that a house should be “a machine for living in.” He was against the standardized interior design trend of the time, fearing that it would make people all too uniform. He moved to Sweden with his Swedish wife in 1933 to escape growing Nazi discrimination and gained citizenship in 1939. He was the most prestigious designer at his Stockholm design company. In addition to his architectural work he created numerous designs for furniture, fabric, wallpaper and carpet."

Even their parents found it hard to tell them apart. But although they looked identical, they were different in every other way. They didn't have anything in common, so they fought all the time. Pamela thought that her sister was weird and incomprehensible, and of course Maggie felt the same way. For example, Pamela was always upset at her sister waking up early in the morning. She didn't understand why her sister couldn't finish what she needed to do at night and sleep peacefully the next morning. To Maggie, staying up past the time she began to feel sleepy was exhausting. Besides, she loved the fresh morning air. They had fights about simple things like this every day. Tired of the endless arguments, their mother Rachel decided to put an end to them. She would make them understand that each of their points of view could be correct. One day, the twins were brought to the dining table where a big board stood in the middle. Pamela sat on one side of the board and her twin on the other. Rachel asked Pamela what the color of the board was. ""Black,"" she said. After hearing Pamela's answer, Rachel asked the same question to the other daughter. She replied it was white. Predictably, they began arguing. Rachel then asked them to switch seats. Each sitting on a new chair, they were surprised to realize the board was black on one side and white on the other. Understanding what their mother wanted to say, they promised they would never insist the other was wrong again."

For instance, during the Middle Ages, the totality of French imports via the Saint-Gothard Passage would not fill a freight train. The amount of freight transported by the Venetian fleet, which dominated Mediterranean trade, would not fill a modern container ship. The volume, but not the speed, of trade improved under mercantilism, notably for maritime transportation. In spite of all, distribution capacities were very limited and speeds slow. For example, a stagecoach going through the English countryside in the sixteenth century had an average speed of 2 miles per hour; moving one ton of cargo 30 miles inland in the United States by the late eighteenth century was as costly as moving it across the Atlantic. The inland transportation system was thus very limited. By the late eighteenth century, canal systems started to emerge in Europe. They permitted the large movements of bulk freight inland and expanded regional trade. Maritime and riverine transportation were consequently the dominant modes of the pre-industrial era."

The grandmother nodded, took the girl by the hand, and walked her to a nearby plant nursery. There, the two of them chose and purchased two small trees. They returned home and planted one of them in the back yard and planted the other tree in a pot and kept it indoors. Then her grandmother asked her which of the trees she thought would be more successful in the future. Yolanda thought for a moment and said the indoor tree would be more successful because it was protected and safe, while the outdoor tree had to cope with the elements. Her grandmother shrugged and said, ""We'll see."" Her grandmother took good care of both trees. In a few years, Yolanda, now a teenager, came to visit her grandmother again. Yolanda reminded her that she had never really answered her question from when she was a little girl about how she could become successful when she grew up. The grandmother showed Yolanda the indoor tree and then took her outside to have a look at the towering tree outside. ""Which one is greater?"" the grandmother asked. Yolanda replied, ""The outside one. But that doesn't make sense; it had to cope with many more challenges than the one inside."" The grandmother smiled and said, ""Remember this, and you will be successful in whatever you do: If you choose the safe option all of your life, you will never grow. But if you are willing to face the world with all of its challenges, you will learn from those challenges and grow to achieve great heights."" Yolanda looked up at the tall tree, took a deep breath, and nodded her head, realizing that her wise grandmother was right."

Instead, they suspected that assessing sleep quality, rather than quantity (time), would shed some light on the mystery. That is, species with superior quality of sleep should be able to accomplish all they need in a shorter time, and vice versa. It was a great idea, with the exception that, if anything, we've discovered the opposite relationship: those that sleep more have deeper, ""higher"" quality sleep. In truth, the way quality is commonly assessed in these investigations (degree of unresponsiveness to the outside world and the continuity of sleep) is probably a poor index of the real biological measure of sleep quality: one that we cannot yet obtain in all these species. When we can, our understanding of the relationship between sleep quantity and quality across the animal kingdom will likely explain what currently appears to be an incomprehensible map of sleep-time differences."

That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet."" This thought of Shakespeare's points up a difference between roses and, say, paintings. Natural objects, such as roses, are not interpreted. They are not taken as vehicles of meanings and messages. They belong to no tradition, strictly speaking have no style, and are not understood within a framework of culture and convention. Rather, they are sensed and savored relatively directly, without intellectual mediation, and so what they are called, either individually or collectively, has little bearing on our experience of them. What a work of art is titled, on the other hand, has a significant effect on the aesthetic face it presents and on the qualities we correctly perceive in it. A painting of a rose, by a name other than the one it has, might very well smell different, aesthetically speaking. The painting titled Rose of Summer and an indiscernible painting titled Vermillion Womanhood are physically, but also semantically and aesthetically, distinct objects of art."

If the theater and actors were traditionally represented by the image of masks, writers such as Shakespeare are implying that all of us are constantly wearing masks. Some people are better actors than others. Evil types such as Iago in the play Othello are able to conceal their hostile intentions behind a friendly smile. Others are able to act with more confidence and bravado - they often become leaders. People with excellent acting skills can better navigate our complex social environments and get ahead."

The show centers on a character named Archie Bunker, an intolerant bigot who often gets into fights with his more progressive family members. Vidmar and Rokeach found that viewers who didn't share Archie Bunker's views thought the show was very funny in the way it made fun of Archie's absurd racism ― in fact, this was the producers' intention. On the other hand, though, viewers who were themselves bigots thought Archie Bunker was the hero of the show and that the producers meant to make fun of his foolish family!

They had to keep accurate time so that monastery bells could be rung at regular intervals to announce the seven hours of the day reserved for prayer. Early clocks were nothing more than a weight tied to a rope wrapped around a revolving drum. Time was determined by watching the length of the weighted rope. The discovery of the pendulum in the seventeenth century led to the widespread use of clocks and enormous public clocks. Eventually, keeping time turned into serving time. People started to follow the mechanical time of clocks rather than their natural body time. They ate at meal time, rather than when they were hungry, and went to bed when it was time, rather than when they were sleepy. Even periodicals and fashions became ""yearly.""

Perhaps this is because there is an undeniable reality to the newspaper itself: it is a real material object. That authenticity rubs off on the news. It can be pointed to, underlined, cut out, pinned on notice boards, stuck in a scrap-book, or archived in libraries. The news becomes an artifact, frozen in time; the event may be long gone, but it lives on as an indisputable fact because of its material presence ― even if it is untrue. In contrast, news websites seem short-lived. Although they too are archived, there is no unique physical component to point to as evidence of the information they convey. For this reason, there is a sense in which they can be more easily manipulated, and that history itself could be altered. At the same time, it is precisely this immediacy and variability of content that makes the digital media so exciting. The news website is in tune with an age that sees history as much less monolithic than previous eras once did. Digital news websites are potentially much more democratic, too, for while a physical newspaper requires huge printing presses and a distribution network linking trains, planes, trucks, shops, and ultimately newspaper sellers, in the digital world a single person can communicate with the whole world with the aid of a single computer and without requiring a single tree to be cut down."

Suspense is driven by a sense of calm with the anticipation of impending terror. Indeed, anticipation or expectations play a key role in driving our emotions. The Russian silent filmmaker Lev Kuleshov considered such contextual influences. He interspersed shots of an actor exhibiting a neutral expression with shots of a child's coffin or a plate of soup. This same ""neutral"" expression was interpreted differently depending on what image preceded it. Thus, the same expression appeared to show sorrow or hunger, depending on the context. Psychological studies of the Kuleshov effect have confirmed the impact of the social context on emotion. For example, if a person smiles at you and then the smile turns into a neutral expression, that person will appear somewhat grumpy or disappointed. Conversely, if a person first looks angry and then the expression turns into a neutral expression, the person looks somewhat pleasant or positive."

Music theorists have identified a principle called gap fill; in a sequence of tones, if a melody makes a large leap, either up or down, the next note should change direction. A typical melody includes a lot of stepwise motion, that is, adjacent tones in the scale. If the melody makes a big leap, theorists describe a tendency for the melody to “want” to return to the jumping-off point; this is another way to say that our brains expect that the leap was only temporary, and tones that follow need to bring us closer and closer to our starting point, or harmonic “home.” In “Over the Rainbow,” the melody begins with one of the largest leaps we’ve ever experienced in a lifetime of music listening: an octave. This is a strong schematic violation, and so the composer rewards and soothes us by bringing the melody back toward home again, but not by too much because he wants to continue to build tension. The third note of this melody fills the gap."

We do not take into account the role that luck plays in such sudden gains. We try again and again to recapture that high from winning so much money or attention. We acquire feelings of superiority. We become especially resistant to anyone who tries to warn us - they don't understand, we tell ourselves.

This helped me understand his methodology, style, and content; and I was able to test it with a lower investment, and less time and effort before committing fully to the expensive program."

If other car drivers or subway users leave for work at 8 a.m., it may be to my advantage to leave at 6 a.m., even if that is really too early from my point of view. In equilibrium, flows stabilize so that each person makes the best trade-off between their ideal schedule and the congestion they will suffer on their commute. In making such choices, agents seek to differentiate their behavior from that of others. On other occasions, agents have a problem with coordination. They would like to choose to behave the same way as others. For example, if most of my fellow citizens did not pay their parking tickets, there would be (unfortunately) strong pressure for an amnesty for such offenders, which would reduce my incentive to pay my parking tickets too. There may be multiple equilibria, so that two otherwise identical societies may adopt different behavioral patterns."

For example, toys that seem to come alive fascinate children. In my day, one of the popular toys was a piece of finely coiled wire called a ""Slinky."" It could appear to walk by stretching and lifting up one end over another down an incline, a bit like an acrobatic caterpillar. The attraction of the Slinky on Christmas Day was the lifelike movement it had as it stepped down the stairs before someone trod on it or twisted the spring and ruined it for good. Toys that appear to be alive are curiosities because they challenge how we think inanimate objects and living things should behave. Many toys today exploit this principle to great effect, but be warned: not all babies enjoy objects that suddenly seem lifelike. This anxiety probably reflects their confusion over the question, ""Is it alive or what?"" Once babies decide that something is alive, they are inclined to see its movements as purposeful."

She dropped out of high school to pursue a full-time acting career and, at 17, she played her first leading role in The Toll of the Sea. Reviewers praised her extraordinary acting but her ethnicity prevented U.S. filmmakers from casting her as a leading lady. Frustrated, Wong left for Europe in 1928, where she had main roles in many notable films. When American studios wanted fresh European talent in the 1930s, Wong’s new prestige immediately led to a main role on Broadway. She returned to America and used her influence to advocate for better film opportunities for Chinese-Americans. In 1938, she sold her movie costumes and donated the money from the sale to organizations supporting Chinese refugees. During World War II, she gave political speeches against the anti-Asian attitudes in the U.S. In 2022, she became the first Asian American to appear on U.S. currency ― a century after she landed her first leading role."

In the case of science and industry, the community prepares the field, yet society tends to give all the credit to the individual who happens to plant a successful seed. Planting a seed does not necessarily require overwhelming intelligence; creating an environment that allows seeds to prosper does. We need to give more credit to the community in science, politics, business, and daily life. Martin Luther King Jr. was a great man. Perhaps his greatest strength was his ability to inspire people to work together to achieve, against all odds, revolutionary changes in society's perception of race and in the fairness of the law. But to really understand what he accomplished requires looking beyond the man. Instead of treating him as the manifestation of everything great, we should appreciate his role in allowing America to show that it can be great."

The plant uses the color of the fruit to signal to predators that it is ripe, which means that the seed's hull has hardened - and therefore the sugar content is at its height. Incredibly, the plant has chosen to manufacture fructose, instead of glucose, as the sugar in the fruit. Glucose raises insulin levels in primates and humans, which initially raises levels of leptin, a hunger‒blocking hormone - but fructose does not. As a result, the predator never receives the normal message that it is full. That makes for a win‒win for predator and prey. The animal obtains more calories, and because it keeps eating more and more fruit and therefore more seeds, the plant has a better chance of distributing more of its babies."

Nevil Maskelyne, one of magic's old masters, claimed that ""the difficulty of producing a new magical effect is about equivalent to that of inventing a new proposition in Euclid."" Whether it's because there's little that's completely new, or for some other reason, magicians seem to worry less about imitation. They do, however, worry a lot about traitors ― those magicians who expose the secrets behind a trick to the public. Once a trick is exposed in this way, its value as ""magic"" is destroyed, and this harms everyone in the industry. For this reason, magicians' norms are focused mostly on punishing magicians who expose tricks to the public ― even if the trick is the exposer's own invention."

Perhaps not. Humans likely evolved to co-sleep as families or even whole tribes, not alone or as couples. Appreciating this evolutionary context, the benefits of such genetically programmed variation in sleep/wake timing preferences can be understood. The night people in the group would not be going to sleep until one or two a.m., and not waking until nine or ten a.m. The morning people, on the other hand, would have retired for the night at nine p.m. and woken at five a.m. Consequently, the group as a whole is only collectively vulnerable (i.e., every person asleep) for just four rather than eight hours, despite everyone still getting the chance for eight hours of sleep. That’s potentially a 50 percent increase in survival fitness. Mother Nature would never pass on a biological trait — here, the useful variability in when individuals within a collective tribe go to sleep and wake up — that could enhance the survival safety and thus fitness of a species by this amount. And so she hasn’t."

His dark trench coat caught Mr. Green's attention. He was Jacob.

At that time, some children didn't have the privilege of a nurturing family. Jacob was one of those children. In the first grade, he required constant reassurance and redirection from his teachers. He often was unable or unwilling to participate or cooperate in the classroom. Mr. Green took the responsibility not only for Jacob's education, but for his social and emotional needs as well. Jacob quickly became one of his favorites, and began to willingly engage in the process of learning. Even after Jacob left first grade, he would return year after year, willing to give up his recess time to see Mr. Green. Jacob simply needed that unconditional acceptance. Family circumstances eventually took Jacob to another state, and with a heavy heart Mr. Green thought he would never see him again. He was worried how life would treat Jacob. So, Mr. Green felt great relief and joy to see him standing in the doorway. He waved Jacob to come in. Entering the classroom, Jacob greeted him back. His eyes darted around Mr. Green's classroom. Suddenly, with a laugh, he asked, ""Do you still have that treasure chest for your students?"" Mr. Green reached under his desk to pull out the old treasure chest. Jacob began digging for his favorite candy. They sat down for conversation over the candies. Jacob must have eaten ten before he was finished. On the way out he gave Mr. Green both a hug and a look of gratitude. Both his stomach and his emotional ""bucket"" were filled."

The great Russian neuropsychologist Alexander Luria studied a patient, Solomon Shereshevsky, with a memory impairment that was the opposite of what we usually hear about ― Solomon didn't have amnesia, the loss of memories; he had what Luria called hypermnesia (we might say that his superpower was superior memory). His supercharged memory allowed him to perform amazing feats, such as repeating speeches word for word that he had heard only once, or complex mathematical formulas, long sequences of numbers, and poems in foreign languages he didn't even speak. Before you think that having such a fantastic memory would be great, it came with a cost: Solomon wasn't able to form abstractions because he remembered every detail as distinct. He had particular trouble identifying people. From a neurocognitive standpoint, every time you see a face, it is likely that it looks at least slightly different from the last time ― you're viewing it at a different angle and distance than before, and you might be encountering a different expression. While you're interacting with a person, their face goes through a parade of expressions. Because your brain can generalize, you see all of these different manifestations of the face as belonging to the same person. Solomon couldn't do that. As he explained to Luria, recognizing his friends and colleagues was nearly impossible because ""everyone has so many faces."""

For another, knowing what their teammates are doing provides a sense of comfort and security, because people can adjust their own behavior to be in harmony with the group. It's risky to go off on their own to try something new that will probably not be successful right from the start.

Many social enterprises are for instance reluctant to make use of traditional commercial finance products, fearing that they might not be able to pay back the loans. In addition, a significant number of social enterprise leaders report that relying too much on grant funding can be a risky strategy since individual grants are time limited and are not reliable in the long term.

Although both hands are now in the same water, one feels that it is colder and the other feels warmer because of the relative change from prior experience.

She came up to me. She spoke some English, and she told me that an accident had happened on the tracks. She asked me where I was trying to get to, then she got off the train and went to a woman in the ticket booth. The old woman got a rail map and timetable from her and came back to tell me that we'd have to hop trains three or four times to get there. I was really glad she was headed the same way because it would have been hopeless for me to figure it out on my own. So we went from one train station to the next, getting to know each other along the way. It was a 2.5-hour journey in total, and when we finally made it to the destination, we got off and said our good-byes. I had made it just in time to catch my train to Rome, and she told me she had a train to catch too. I asked her how much farther she had to go, and it turned out her home was two hours back the other way. She had jumped from train to train and traveled the whole way just to make sure I made it. ""You are the nicest person I've ever met,"" I said. She smiled gently and hugged me and told me I'd better hurry off so I wouldn't miss my train. This woman spent her entire day sitting on trains taking her hours away from her home just to help out a confused tourist visiting her country. No matter how many countries I visit or sites I see, I always say the most beautiful country in the world is Switzerland."

Furthermore, the restrictive ingredient lists and design criteria that are typical of such products may make green products inferior to mainstream products on core performance dimensions (e.g., less effective cleansers). In turn, the higher costs and lower performance of some products attract only a small portion of the customer base, leading to lower economies of scale in procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. Even if the green product succeeds, it may cannibalize the company's higher-profit mainstream offerings. Given such downsides, companies serving mainstream consumers with successful mainstream products face what seems like an obvious investment decision. They'd rather put money and time into known, profitable, high-volume products that serve populous customer segments than into risky, less-profitable, low-volume products that may serve current noncustomers. Given that choice, these companies may choose to leave the green segment of the market to small niche competitors."

Everybody feels different and special and expects products serving his or her inclinations. In reality, these supposedly individual preferences end up overlapping with emerging, temporary, always changing, almost tribal formations solidifying around cultural sensibilities, social identifications, political sensibilities, and dietary and health concerns.

One group (the experimental group) receives a vitamin C supplement, and the other (the control group) does not. Researchers observe both groups to determine whether one group has fewer or shorter colds than the other. The following discussion describes some of the pitfalls inherent in an experiment of this kind and ways to avoid them. In sorting subjects into two groups, researchers must ensure that each person has an equal chance of being assigned to either the experimental group or the control group. This is accomplished by randomization; that is, the subjects are chosen randomly from the same population by flipping a coin or some other method involving chance. Randomization helps to ensure that results reflect the treatment and not factors that might influence the grouping of subjects. Importantly, the two groups of people must be similar and must have the same track record with respect to colds to rule out the possibility that observed differences in the rate, severity, or duration of colds might have occurred anyway. If, for example, the control group would normally catch twice as many colds as the experimental group, then the findings prove nothing. In experiments involving a nutrient, the diets of both groups must also be similar, especially with respect to the nutrient being studied. If those in the experimental group were receiving less vitamin C from their usual diet, then any effects of the supplement may not be apparent."

Utilitarian ethics assumes that all actions can be evaluated in terms of their moral worth, and so the desirability of an action is determined by its resulting hedonistic consequences. This is a consequentialist creed, assuming that the moral value and desirability of an action can be determined from its likely outcomes. Jeremy Bentham suggested that the value of hedonistic outcomes can be quantitatively assessed, so that the value of consequent pleasure can be derived by multiplying its intensity and its duration. In contrast, the other major advocate of utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill, argued for a more qualitative approach, assuming that there can be different subjective levels of pleasure. Higher-quality pleasures are more desirable than lower-quality pleasures. Less sophisticated creatures (like pigs!) have an easier access to the simpler pleasures, but more sophisticated creatures like humans have the capacity to access higher pleasures and should be motivated to seek those."

Doing hands-on activities that produce results you can see and touch ― such as knitting a scarf, cooking from scratch, or tending a garden ― fuels the reward circuit so that it functions optimally. She argues that the documented increase in depression among Americans may be directly correlated with the decline of purposeful physical activity. When we work with our hands, it increases the release of the neurochemicals dopamine and serotonin, both responsible for generating positive emotions. She also explains that working with our hands gives us a greater sense of control over our environment and more connection to the world around us.

During their life cycle (cell cycle), cell size, shape, and metabolic activities can change dramatically. A cell is ""born"" as a twin when its mother cell divides, producing two daughter cells. Each daughter cell is smaller than the mother cell, and except for unusual cases, each grows until it becomes as large as the mother cell was. During this time, the cell absorbs water, sugars, amino acids, and other nutrients and assembles them into new, living protoplasm. After the cell has grown to the proper size, its metabolism shifts as it either prepares to divide or matures and differentiates into a specialized cell. Both growth and development require a complex and dynamic set of interactions involving all cell parts. That cell metabolism and structure should be complex would not be surprising, but actually, they are rather simple and logical. Even the most complex cell has only a small number of parts, each responsible for a distinct, well-defined aspect of cell life."

Inorganic nitrogen supplies are essential for maintaining moderate to high levels of productivity for many of the non-leguminous crop species, because organic supplies of nitrogenous materials often are either limited or more expensive than inorganic nitrogen fertilizers. In addition, there are constraints to the extensive use of either manure or legumes as ""green manure"" crops. In many cases, weed control can be very difficult or require much hand labor if chemicals cannot be used, and fewer people are willing to do this work as societies become wealthier.

Yates, a prominent UK statistician. During his student years at St. John's College, Cambridge, Yates had been keen on a form of sport. It consisted of climbing about the roofs and towers of the college buildings at night. In particular, the chapel of St. John's College has a massive neo-Gothic tower adorned with statues of saints, and to Yates it appeared obvious that it would be more decorous if these saints were properly attired in surplices. One night he climbed up and did the job; next morning the result was generally much admired. But the College authorities were unappreciative and began to consider means of divesting the saints of their newly acquired garments. This was not easy, since they were well out of reach of any ordinary ladder. An attempt to lift the surplices off from above, using ropes with hooks attached, was unsuccessful. No progress was being made and eventually Yates came forward and volunteered to climb up in the daylight and bring them down. This he did to the admiration of the crowd that assembled."

Rodgers, a vice president of a big company, was once taught the simple idea of pausing to refresh. It began when Jeff realized that as he drove home from work each evening his mind was still focused on work-related projects. We all know this feeling. We may have left the office physically, but we are very much still there mentally, as our minds get caught in the endless loop of replaying the events of today and worrying about all the things we need to get done the following day. So now, as he gets to the door of his house, he applies what he calls ""the pause that refreshes."" He stops for just a moment. He closes his eyes. He breathes in and out once: deeply and slowly. As he exhales, he lets the work issues fall away. This allows him to walk through the front door to his family with more singleness of purpose. It supports the sentiment attributed to Lao Tzu: ""In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present."""

Bundle pricing facilitates customer satisfaction and, when slow-moving products are bundled with products with higher turnover, can help a company stimulate sales and increase revenues. Selling products as a package rather than individually also may result in cost savings, so bundle pricing is commonly used for banking and travel services, computers, and automobiles with option packages. Some organizations, however, are unbundling in favor of a more itemized approach sometimes called à la carte pricing. This provides customers with the opportunity to pick and choose the products they want without having to purchase bundles that may not be the right mix for their purposes. Furthermore, with the help of the Internet, comparison shopping has become more convenient than ever, allowing customers to price items and create their own mixes. Nevertheless, bundle pricing continues to appeal to customers who prefer the convenience of a package."

Regular attendance at school is essential in maximizing student potential. Recently, we've become concerned about the number of unapproved absences across all grades. I would like to further clarify that your role as a parent is to approve any school absence. Parents must provide an explanation for absences to the school within 7 days from the first day of any period of absence. Where an explanation has not been received within the 7-day time frame, the school will record the absence as unjustified on the student's record. Please ensure that you go to the parent portal site and register the reason any time your child is absent. Please approve all absences, so that your child will not be at a disadvantage. Many thanks for your cooperation.

There are several different types of creativity ― some of them conscious, some of them unconscious. Creativity can happen when you deliberately try to create something or it can happen in your sleep. In any case, Arne Dietrich, a neuroscientist, believes that the creative brain might work much like software. Neuroscientists suspect that creativity is essentially about discovery rather than anything mystical ― driven by a mechanical process in the brain that generates possible solutions and then eliminates them systematically. He believes our tendency to dismiss computational creativity as inferior to our own comes from an ingrained dualism in human culture. 'We are overvaluing ourselves and underestimating them,' he says. As a neuroscientist, Dietrich says he tackles the brain as a machine ― and does not see machine creativity as different. Considered in this way, the idea that the human brain has a unique claim to creative talents seems a limited perspective. Will others accept that idea? The trick is to stop trying to compare computer artists to human ones. If we can embrace computer creativity for what it is and stop trying to make it look human, not only will computers teach us new things about our own creative talents, but they might become creative in ways that we cannot begin to imagine."

The vessels constantly cast shadows as light streams into the eye, but because these shadows never move, the brain ceases responding to them. Moving the flashlight beam around shifts the shadows just enough to make them momentarily visible. Now you might wonder if you could cause an image to fade just by staring at something unmoving. But that is not possible because the visual system constantly jiggles the eye muscles, which prevents the perfect stabilization of images of the world. These muscle movements are unbelievably small, but their effect is huge. Without them, we would go blind by tuning out what we see shortly after fixating our gaze!

Clever advertising informs children that they will be viewed by their peers in an unfavorable way if they do not have the products that are advertised, thereby playing on their emotional vulnerabilities.

But even within this strange group, in which foodtrapping mechanisms have evolved multiple times independently, some unusual ones stand out. According to Ulrike Bauer, an evolutionary biologist, the visually striking pitcher plant Nepenthes gracilis, for example, can exploit external energy for a purpose. This species' pitcher has a rigid, horizontal lid with an exposed underside that produces nectar, luring insects to land on it. When a raindrop strikes the lid's top, the lid jolts downward and throws any unsuspecting visitor into digestive juices below. Researchers used x-ray scans to analyze cross sections of the pitchers when the lid is raised, lowered, and in a neutral position. Their results revealed a structural weak point in the pitcher's neck: when a raindrop hits the lid, the weak spot folds in and forces the lid to quickly move downward, similar to a diving board. The weak point makes the pitcher's body bend and bounce back in a specific, consistent way, so the lid rises back up without bouncing too far ― unlike a typical leaf's chaotic vibration when struck by rain."

Sometimes these scenarios are drawn from books, movies, and television. Other times, philosophers just make up their own scenarios. Either way, the point is to put such concepts to the test. In the case of time travel, for example, a common thought experiment is to imagine what would happen if you went back in time and found yourself in a position to interfere in such a way that you were never born. It seems that something must happen to prevent you from doing this, because if you were to succeed, you would not exist and so you would not have been able to go back in time.

These rare individuals can drink an espresso with dinner and fall fast asleep at midnight without a problem. Others, however, have a slower-acting version of the enzyme. It takes far longer for their system to eliminate the same amount of caffeine. As a result, they are very sensitive to caffeine’s effects. One cup of tea or coffee in the morning will last much of the day, and should they have a second cup, even early in the afternoon, they will find it difficult to fall asleep in the evening.

Galileo's breakthroughs came in part from his understanding of how to use shadows to extend his powers of observation. At the time he trained his telescope on Venus, it was believed the planet shone with its own light and moved in an orbit independent of the sun. Galileo saw that the planet was in partial shadow as it went through its phases, and thus had to be a dark body. He also realized from the logic of the shadow that Venus orbited the sun, since all phases from new to full could be observed from earth. The end of the Ptolemaic system came quickly thereafter, a shadow thus shedding light on the ordering of the cosmos."

Although the brain accounts for merely 3 percent of a person’s body weight, it consumes 20 percent of the available fuel. Your brain can’t store fuel, however, so it has to “pay as it goes.” Since your brain is incredibly adaptive, it economizes its fuel resources. Thus, during a period of high stress, it shifts away from the analysis of the nuances of a situation to a singular and fixed focus on the stressful situation at hand. You don’t sit back and speculate about the meaning of life when you are stressed. Instead, you devote all your energy to trying to figure out what action to take. Sometimes, however, this shift from the higher-thinking parts of the brain to the automatic and reflexive parts of the brain can lead you to do something too quickly, without thinking."

Sumerian cuneiform was a linear writing system, its symbols usually set in columns, read from top to bottom and from left to right. This regimentation was a form of abstraction: the world is not a linear place, and objects do not organize themselves horizontally or vertically in real life. Early rock paintings, thought to have been created for ritual purposes, were possibly shaped and organized to follow the walls of the cave, or the desires of the painters, who may have organized them symbolically, or artistically, or even randomly. Yet after cuneiform, virtually every form of script that has emerged has been set out in rows with a clear beginning and endpoint. So uniform is this expectation, indeed, that the odd exception is noteworthy, and generally established for a specific purpose."

The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a toy for your child and soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go with it. It's a chain reaction of purchases. Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior."

Commitments make individuals' behavior predictable in the face of fluctuations in their desires and interests, thereby facilitating the planning and coordination of joint actions involving multiple agents. Moreover, commitments make people willing to perform actions that they would not otherwise perform. For example, a taxi driver picks up his clients and transports them to their desired destination because they are committed to paying him afterwards for the service, and a construction worker performs her job every day because her employer has made a credible commitment to pay her at the end of the month. Indeed, the taxi driver and the construction worker are willing to accept money as payment only because a network of other agents (notably the central bank) is committed to taking various measures to sustain the currency in question. Thus, social objects and institutions such as jobs, money, government, scientific collaborations and marriage depend for their origin and stability upon the credibility of commitments."

I suspect that most people view flavor as of secondary importance in social settings where food is served. Although our social gatherings coalesce around food, the meaning of these gatherings does not seem to depend on flavor. Flavor assists with the narrow purpose of filling the belly, and once that is accomplished it provides the backdrop for whatever social dynamics characterize the gathering. These can be understood independently of the flavor of the food on offer, the appreciation of which is understood to be personal and subjective. According to this conventional wisdom, the ceremonies and rituals around food, the social events that supply food with its meaning, do not depend on the quality of sensations provided by the food. To focus excessively on flavor is to miss the larger significance of these social relations."

The best narrative nonfiction writers often turn to time-honored tools of fiction writers for effect: plot and pacing, character and drama, and, yes, suspense. And they understand that a good story just can’t spread out in all directions like a serving of spaghetti. The story needs form, shape, a structure designed to pull the reader from start to finish. “The craftsmanship of the writer is no less beautiful than that of the cabinet maker or the builder of temples or fine violins,” writes Jon Franklin. Yes, this may sound grandiose, but the emphasis on craftsmanship is pure pragmatism: a knowledge of the basic structures that narrative science writers use to build an effective story. I think of this approach as journalistic architecture. Once a writer has the story blueprints in hand, so to speak, then he or she can decide which structure best fits the facts of the story — and where to slot them into place."

One prominent idea is that we are born with a fixed set of basic emotions that are universal within our species, notably happiness, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust and anger. Just as we attach the word gravity to our intuitive understanding about how objects move through space, we simply attach words to each of these innate and universal emotions once those words become available. An alternative view is that we make sense of the sensations we feel and the facial expressions we see only when we attach words to them ― we develop rather than inherit our emotional concepts. Key evidence is that children are unable to categorise facial expressions as representing different emotions until they have acquired a lexicon of words for emotions. Before having such words, faces that we might view as angry, sad or fearful are all categorised together as ‘unpleasant’. By acquiring the words for different types of emotions while experiencing sensations or observing their expressions in others, we develop a set of concepts into which those feelings can be placed."

The methods of copying available to us have never been more powerfully abundant. This seems true even as a sense of loss has attended our ever more powerful means to reproduce what we care about. Walter Benjamin has famously formulated this loss as an “aura”: that which is lost in mechanical reproduction. The aura of a work of art, he suggests, cannot be copied by mechanical technology. By around 1900, he writes, “technical reproduction had reached a standard that not only permitted it to reproduce all transmitted works of art and thus to cause the most profound change in their impact upon the public.” The ability to copy mechanically “substituted a plurality of copies for a unique existence,” Benjamin argued. In addition to transforming art and the public’s relation to it, Benjamin asserted that mechanical reproduction has the power to rend traditions by interfering with the authority of objects “embedded in the fabric of tradition.” This threat to tradition was twofold and concerned the presence of objects, Benjamin believed."

Suddenly, in the 1950s, anyone could pick up spoons, a couple of pans, a second-hand guitar and start a band. This led to specific genres such as skiffle, but also, more generally, reflected a much more relaxed and inclusive attitude to music making. While ordinary people had always sung and made music, the popular music movement was driven by a spirit of rebellion and freedom. This approach led to the punk movement, whose musicians even made it a condition for their music to be non-virtuosic and accessible to all in the 1970s. Groups who had been entirely excluded from music revelled in opportunities to create. This led to a sense of novelty and empowerment in and beyond the music sphere."

He worked hard for many years, but things didn’t improve. He sold his farm to his neighbor, Victor, who was by no means wealthy. Hoping for a fresh start, he left for the big city to find better opportunities. Years passed, but Jack still couldn’t find the fortune he was looking for. Tired and broke, he returned to the area where his old farm was.
One day, he drove past his old land and was shocked by what he saw. Victor, the man who had bought the farm with very little money, now seemed to be living a life of great success. He had torn down the farmhouse and built a massive house in its place. New buildings, trees, and flowers adorned the well-kept property. Jack could hardly believe that he had ever worked on this same land. Curious, he stopped to talk to Victor.
“How did you do all this?” he asked. And he continued, “When you bought the farm, you barely had any money. How did you get so rich?” Victor smiled and said, “I owe it all to you. There were diamonds on this land —acres and acres of diamonds! I got rich because I discovered those diamonds.” “Diamonds?” Jack said in disbelief. And he said, “I knew every part of that land, and there were no diamonds!”
Victor reached into his pocket and carefully pulled out something small and shiny. Holding it between his fingers, he let it catch the light. He said, “This is a diamond.” Jack was amazed and said, “I saw so many rocks like that and thought they were useless. They made farming so hard!” Victor laughed and said, “You didn’t know what diamonds look like. Sometimes, treasures are hidden right in front of us.”"

It would be a language in which every word was a proper noun. Because you don’t want to gloss over the differences between snakes that are slightly different in some respect, every snake must have its own name. Furthermore, every event must have its own verb, because not every occasion of thinking or dancing or talking is identical. There might be some superintelligent race of beings that could know such a language, but they would have to know virtually everything in the world to learn all these names. Human language has taken a different route — many fewer names, with a loss of precision, but a basic vocabulary that is readily acquired. However, this fact is not simply a compromise with our limited cognitive capacity. By using the same word for different objects, we’re communicating information about those things. Calling two different-looking things “spider” communicates that they probably have eight legs, weave nests, eat insects, and other noticeable details, which we would not know if we gave them all their own separate names."

For instance, it turned out that psychoanalysis’s attempt to delimit the sources of error by categorizing the kinds of mistakes to which humans are subject in light of the therapeutic situation in the talking cure draws on misguided assumptions about the normalcy conditions for subjects. Digging deeper into the structure of the human mind as well as into the specific embodiment of human knowers equipped with a complex nervous system showed that our mental life is filled with illusions on all levels of knowledge acquisition, from sensation to perception, from scientific discourse to the use of technology based on the latest scientific discovery. Yet, once again, we cannot make sense of this picture of ourselves as immersed in the area of ignorance and illusion without at the same time relying on a huge background of shared, objective knowledge that makes our ignorance available to us. Subjectivity and objectivity are interwoven with our fallibility."

Some people say it's because of what they eat. Their diet is full of fresh fruits, fish, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts. Individuals in these cultures drink red wine and use great amounts of olive oil. Why is that food pattern healthy? One reason is that they are eating a palette of colors. More and more research is surfacing that shows us the benefits of the thousands of colorful ""phytochemicals"" (phyto=plant) that exist in foods. These healthful, non-nutritive compounds in plants provide color and function to the plant and add to the health of the human body. Each color connects to a particular compound that serves a specific function in the body.

But even stronger, especially when we're young, are our friends. We often choose friends as a way of expanding our sense of identity beyond our families. As a result, the pressure to conform to the standards and expectations of friends and other social groups is likely to be intense. Judith Rich Harris, who is a developmental psychologist, argues that three main forces shape our development: personal temperament, our parents, and our peers. The influence of peers, she argues, is much stronger than that of parents. ""The world that children share with their peers,"" she says, ""is what shapes their behavior and modifies the characteristics they were born with, and hence determines the sort of people they will be when they grow up."""

That ability let our ancestors outmaneuver and outrun prey. Try wearing a couple of extra jackets — or better yet, fur coats — on a hot humid day and run a mile.

As you read it over, the material is familiar because you remember it from before, and this familiarity might lead you to think, ""Okay, I know that."" The problem is that this feeling of familiarity is not necessarily equivalent to knowing the material and may be of no help when you have to come up with an answer on the exam.

This surprises many, as it sounds just a little too cold for comfort. Of course, that specific temperature will vary depending on the individual in question and their gender and age. But like calorie recommendations, it's a good target for the average human being. Most of us set bedroom temperatures higher than are ideal for good sleep and this likely contributes to lower quantity and quality of sleep than you are otherwise capable of getting. Lower than 55 degrees Fahrenheit can be harmful rather than helpful to sleep, unless warm bedding or nightclothes are used. However, most of us fall into the opposite category of setting a controlled bedroom temperature that is too high: 70 or 72 degrees. Sleep clinicians treating patients who can't sleep at night will often ask about room temperature, and will advise patients to lower their current thermostat set-point by 3 to 5 degrees from that which they currently use. Anyone disbelieving of the influence of temperature on sleep can explore some related experiments on this topic. Scientists have, for example, gently warmed the feet or the body of rats to encourage blood to rise to the surface of the skin and release heat, thereby decreasing core body temperature.

This has led to increased pressure on agricultural land for exchange commodities and export goods. More land is being diverted from local food production to ""cash crops"" for export and exchange; fewer types of crops are raised, and each crop is raised in much greater quantities than before. Thus, ever more land is converted from forest (and other natural systems) for agriculture for export, rather than using land for subsistence crops."

Part of the reason is that rather than relying on a clearly validated set of scientific discoveries, managers use less reliable sources of insight such as gut feel, intuition, the latest trend, what a highly paid consultant might say, or what is being done in another company.

Want-should conflicts fundamentally involve tradeoffs between options that satisfy the present self’s desires (wants) and options that benefit the future self (shoulds). As a result, when we do not feel psychologically connected to our future self, we should be less interested in taking actions to benefit this self and thus shy away from should options. Indeed, an emerging stream of research suggests that people are more impatient the more disconnected they feel from their future self. For example, people prefer smaller-sooner rewards over larger-later rewards at a higher rate when they anticipate experiencing life-changing events (rather than events that are unlikely to change their identity and beliefs), since life-changing events induce a greater disassociation between their image of their present self and their image of their future self. More generally, when people are told that their identity will change considerably over time, they are more likely to accept immediate benefits (wants) and forsake larger deferred benefits (shoulds). On the other hand, farsighted decision making can be facilitated by making people feel closer to their future self."

Also called the ‘decisionist model’, this form of technocracy institutionalizes a division of labour based on the distinction between facts and values and allows specialist experts to wield significant power. This is because policy-makers work within the constraints set by the experts and choose from the options those experts provide.

Rousseau believed that people are not born but made, every individual a bundle of potentials whose realization requires the active involvement of other people. Self-development is a social process. Self-sufficiency is an impossible fantasy. Much of the time Rousseau wished passionately that it were not: Robinson Crusoe was a favorite book, and he yearned to be free from the pains and uncertainties of social life. But his writings document with extraordinary clarity the shaping of the individual by his emotional attachments. ""Our sweetest existence is relative and collective, and our true self is not entirely within us."" And it is kindness ― which Rousseau analyzed under the rubric of pitie, which translates as ""pity"" but is much closer to ""sympathy"" as Hume and Smith defined it ― that is the key to this collective existence."

One very important distinction is that all other animals use one call for one message as the general principle of communication. This means that the number of possible messages is very restricted. If a new message is to be included in the system, a new sound has to be introduced, too. After the first few tens of sounds it becomes difficult to invent new distinctive sounds, and also to remember them for the next time they are needed. Human speech builds on the principle of combining a restricted number of sounds into an unlimited number of messages. In a typical human language there are something like thirty or forty distinctive speech sounds. These sounds can be combined into chains to form a literally unlimited number of words. Even a small child, who can communicate by only one word at a time, uses a system for communication that is infinitely superior to any system utilized by any other animal."

It exists only in practice. When we talk about practical knowledge, we tend to use bodily metaphors. We say that somebody has a touch for doing some activity — an ability to hit the right piano key with just enough force and pace. We say that somebody has a feel for the game, an intuition for how events are going to unfold, an awareness of when you should plow ahead with a problem and when you should put it aside before coming back to it. When the expert is using her practical knowledge, she isn’t thinking more; she is thinking less. She has built up a repertoire of skills through habit and has thereby extended the number of tasks she can perform without conscious awareness. This sort of knowledge is built up through experience, and it is passed along through shared experience."

At least 64,000 years ago, Neanderthals used colored oxide and charcoal to make paintings of large wild animals, tracings of human hands, and abstract patterns on cave and rock walls. Today, people create images with a multitude of mediums, including photography. What drives this picturemaking impulse? Some make pictures for commercial reasons. Others create informational systems or employ scientific imaging tools to visualize the unseen. Artists use images expressionistically, to conceptualize and articulate who they are and how they view the world. However, the fundamental motive for making the vast majority of pictures is a desire to preserve: to document, and therefore honor, specific people, events, and possessions of importance. Regardless of purpose, the making of images persists because words alone cannot always provide a satisfactory way to describe and express our relationship to the world. Pictures are an essential component of how humans observe, communicate, celebrate, comment, and, most of all, remember. What and how we remember shapes our worldview, and pictures can provide a stimulus to jog one’s memory."

Our shared reality grounds us not just in our common perceptions but in similar feelings and worldviews. This helps to preserve our core values and beliefs about ourselves. It also provides us with meaning and a feeling of self-worth. And with each decision or interaction that confirms our tribe’s common experience, we get rewarded with the hormonal happiness we crave. Our perception of ourselves is a mixture of our own unique characteristics and our sense of belonging to our in-groups. In fact, our personal identity is so closely interwoven with our social identity that our brains can’t tell them apart.

This break from the hierarchy is called ""puppy license"" by the behaviorists who see it in dogs, but it's a feature of family dynamics in a range of species. Older animals will overlook, or gently correct, an inappropriate display of dominance as long as the offender is young enough not to know better. Puppy license also covers play: older dogs seem to enjoy puppy playfulness, and may encourage young dogs by wrestling more gently, barking more softly, and sometimes letting the puppies win. As soon as that young dog hits a certain point in adolescence, however, its puppy license expires. Behaviors that were lightheartedly tolerated just a few days before are now met with adult pushback. Although the dog is still young and may lack experience, it is challenged and treated like an adult. In the human world and in the dog world, as juveniles mature into wildhood and their puppy licenses are no longer valid, a tolerant world becomes irritated and intolerant."

For example, in a study by Meltzoff (1988), 14-month-old children observed an adult bend at the waist and touch its head to a panel, thus turning on a light. They followed suit. Infants engaged in this somewhat unusual and awkward behavior, even though it would have been easier and more natural for them simply to push the panel with their hand. One interpretation of this behavior is that infants understood that the adult had the goal of illuminating the light and then chose one means for doing so, from among other possible means, and if they had the same goal, they could choose the same means. Similarly, Carpenter et al. (1998) found that 16-month-old infants will imitatively learn from a complex behavioral sequence only those behaviors that appear intentional, ignoring those that appear accidental. Young children do not just imitate the limb movements of other persons, they attempt to reproduce other persons' intended actions in the world."

As we grow older, however, this capacity can atrophy. We start to pay increasing attention to what people say rather than what they do, to the point where we can fail to notice nonlinguistic clues. Spoken language is so information rich that it lulls us into ignoring hints that someone might be, say, upset and instead focus on their words when they say, It's nothing. I feel fine. Some people, however, have a talent for detecting emotions, even when they're unspoken. We all know people like this: Friends who seem to intuit when we're feeling down, even if we haven't said anything; managers who sense when a kind word is needed to help us get over the hump at work. It's natural to assume these people are unusually observant, or uncommonly sensitive. Sometimes they are. But years of research indicates this is a skill anyone can develop. We can learn to identify the nonverbal clues that indicate someone's true emotions and use these hints to understand what they are feeling."

This focus reflects a tradition of philosophers like Pope and Rumi presenting their philosophical work in verse. In addition, poets like William Wordsworth and T. S. Eliot have been celebrated as poet-philosophers, with their work valued as the product of philosophy through poetry. However, arguments against poetry having a role to play in philosophical inquiry have tended to focus on poetry's (negative) relationship to truth (or, as John Koethe puts it, poetry's indifference to truth). Although we may accept works of poetry as having philosophical themes, this does not amount to doing philosophy through poetry. One such argument hinges on the non-paraphrasability of poetry and form-content unity. The thought goes, if poetry is to play a role in philosophy, then it needs to be paraphrasable (that is, its content must be separable from its form). The assumption is that paraphrase is a mark of understanding and indicates that some proposition has a fixed meaning and that only a proposition with a fixed meaning can be evaluated in terms of truth or falsity. Poetry resists paraphrase: to change the words is to change the poem. "

As Apgar studied, she became interested in the way anesthesia given to mothers in labor affected babies.

According to the method, doctors must consider five different factors, including heart rate and breathing effort, when they inspect babies.

Furthermore, by taking more and more readings, we obtain from the arithmetic mean a value which approaches more and more closely to the true value. Neither of these points is true for a systematic error. Repeated measurements with the same apparatus neither reveal nor do they eliminate a systematic error. For this reason systematic errors are potentially more dangerous than random errors. If large random errors are present in an experiment, they will manifest themselves in a large value of the final quoted error. Thus everyone is aware of the imprecision of the result, and no harm is done ― except possibly to the ego of the experimenter when no one takes notice of his or her results. However, the concealed presence of a systematic error may lead to an apparently reliable result, given with a small estimated error, which is in fact seriously wrong."

Specifically, the pauses and delays that characterize everyday life are removed through editing, and new accents are added ― namely, a laugh track. The familiar result is a compressed event in which action flows with rapid ease, compacting hours or even days into minutes, and minutes into seconds. Audiences are spared the waiting common to everyday life. Although this use of time may appear unnatural in the abstract, the television audience has come to expect it, and critics demand it. More important, television performers, or people who depend on television, such as politicians, are evaluated by viewers (voters) on their ability to meet time compression requirements, such as the one sentence graphic statement or metaphor to capture the moment. It is the statement that is in bold print or the boxed insert in newspaper and magazine articles. As such, compression techniques accentuate another important temporal dimension of television ― rhythm and tempo."

Economists think about progress in terms of enabling and replacing technologies. The telescope, whose invention allowed astronomers to gaze at the moons of Jupiter, did not displace laborers in large numbers ─ instead, it enabled us to perform new and previously unimaginable tasks. This contrasts with the arrival of the power loom, which replaced hand-loom weavers performing existing tasks and therefore prompted opposition as weavers found their incomes threatened. Thus, it stands to reason that when technologies take the form of capital that replaces workers, they are more likely to be resisted. The spread of every technology is a decision, and if some people stand to lose their jobs as a consequence, adoption will not be frictionless. Progress is not inevitable and for some it is not even desirable. Though it is often taken as a given, there is no fundamental reason why technological ingenuity should always be allowed to thrive."

Riding updrafts to gain altitude is one of the most conspicuous. Bare ground such as fields or parking lots absorbs more heat from the sun, and as air near the ground warms up it rises. This creates a column of rising warm air ― a thermal ― reaching hundreds or even thousands of feet high. A soaring bird can sense the air movement and fly in circles to stay in the column. It simply fans its wings and tail and lets the rising air carry it up like an elevator. When it reaches the top, the bird bends its wings and glides in the direction it wants to travel, searching for the next thermal. All soaring birds take advantage of thermals, but some species, like the Broad-winged Hawk, are specialists and in the right conditions can travel hundreds of miles with almost no flapping."

Enter the librarian. She asks one why he wants the window open: ""To get some fresh air."" She asks the other why he wants it closed: ""To avoid a draft."" After thinking a minute, she opens wide a window in the next room, bringing in fresh air without a draft. This story is typical of many negotiations. Since the parties' problem appears to be a conflict of positions, they naturally tend to talk about positions—and often reach an impasse.

We want to seem trustworthy, and reputation management as a trustworthy individual often overrides most other concerns, even our own mortality. This is not entirely irrational. A human alone in this world faces a lot of difficulty, but being alone in the world before modern times was almost certainly a death sentence. So we carry with us an innate drive to form groups, join groups, remain in those groups, and oppose other groups. But once you can identify them, you start favoring us; so much so that given a choice between an outcome that favors both groups a lot or one that favors both much less but still favors yours more than theirs, that's the one you will pick."

And it is not just those people with power — we need to feel valued and respected by peers and coworkers. Thus, when the need for relatedness is met, motivation and internalization are fueled, provided that support for autonomy and competence are also there. If we are trying to motivate others, a caring relationship is a crucial basis from which to begin. And when we are trying to motivate ourselves, doing things to enhance a sense of connectedness to others can be crucial to long-term persistence. So exercise with a friend, call someone when you have a difficult decision to make, and be there as a support for others as they take on challenges."

There is intense activity in areas associated with pronunciation and hearing the sound of the spoken response, which strengthens the connective structures of your brain cells for more brainpower. This leads to an overall improvement in concentration. Reading aloud is also a good way to develop your public speaking skills because it forces you to read each and every word — something people don’t often do when reading quickly, or reading in silence. Children, in particular, should be encouraged to read aloud because the brain is wired for learning through connections that are created by positive stimulation, such as singing, touching, and reading aloud."

This observation is related to the idea that visual space is not open but ends at visible surfaces or, indeed, the sky. Uexküll and Kriszat (1934) suggested that this is realized as a hard limit, which they call the “farthest plane.” If an observed person or object would walk beyond this farthest plane, it would no longer be perceived as moving further away, but rather as shrinking in size. This observation is actually quite common; if looking down from a high tower, for example, cars or even houses on the ground below may appear as if they were toys: that is, shrunk, presumably because they are perceived at the distance of the farthest plane while subtending a visual angle that corresponds to a larger distance. The farthest plane would thus mark the limit of the perception of size constancy."

He displayed a marked interest in science at an early age. He studied chemistry, mathematics, and physics at the University of Halle and also studied mineralogy at the Mining Academy. In his late twenties, he went to Austria and classified minerals by their physical attributes. This new classification system of his led to conflicts with many mineralogists who followed the conventional methods. In 1812, Mohs was appointed Professor of Mineralogy at the Joanneum, where he developed the Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness. Mohs ended his remarkable career at the Mining University in Leoben and died at the age of 66 in Italy."

Yet once it becomes possible to transform an embryo’s mutated genes into “normal” ones, there will certainly be temptations to upgrade normal genes to superior versions. Should we begin editing genes in unborn children to lower their lifetime risk of heart disease or cancer? What about giving unborn children beneficial features, like greater strength and increased mental abilities, or changing physical characteristics, like eye and hair color? The pursuit for perfection seems almost natural to human nature, but if we start down this slippery slope, we may not like where we end up."

She paused for a moment, then called out, “Hey, Eva! How about staying a little longer? We can work on some drills — just the two of us.” Eva hesitated. “I don’t know, Coach. I’m pretty tired.” Ms. Blake gave her a warm smile. “Just ten minutes. It’ll be fun. I promise.” Finally, Eva agreed, though she still seemed reluctant. They practiced passing the ball together.
Ms. Blake noticed that Eva’s movements were slow and that her focus seemed elsewhere. Breaking the silence, Ms. Blake asked, “Do you remember the final game last year?” “Yeah, I remember.” Eva recalled the game where she scored three goals. “I was quite good back then.” “You still are,” replied Ms. Blake. “Well, now I’m so worried I can’t score a goal or even pass the ball properly. I’m afraid of making mistakes,” said Eva.
Ms. Blake stepped closer and placed a reassuring hand on Eva’s shoulder. She suggested, “You don’t have to be perfect. Soccer isn’t about perfection — it’s about passion. And you’ve always had plenty of that.” Eva’s gaze met Ms. Blake’s. “Do you really think so?” Ms. Blake said firmly, “Yes. The way you play, the energy you bring — that’s what makes you special. Not the goals scored or the trophies won. It’s the love you have for the game.” Eva nodded thoughtfully.
The next game, Ms. Blake watched from the sidelines as Eva played. There was a new confidence that hadn’t been there before. Eva didn’t score but led the team successfully. After the game she ran over, saying, “Thanks for believing in me, Coach.” Ms. Blake smiled back. “You’ve always had it in you. I’m just here to remind you of that.” Eva’s face softened, as she realized she had been too hard on herself. She said to herself, “What matters is doing my best, not being perfect.”"

James and his younger brother, Daniel, both applied for the Spark Fellowship. The Spark Fellowship was a highly respected program that selects and supports outstanding students every two years. Unsurprisingly, both brothers advanced to the final round.
However, the program had a strict rule: only one family member could be selected in the same year. This posed a challenge to the selection committee, who thought it almost impossible to choose between the two equally impressive candidates. The committee gathered together, struggling all day long to decide. When James found out about this rule, he tried to seek a way to demonstrate Daniel’s exceptional talent to the selection committee.
Without Daniel knowing, James went to the selection committee. He told the committee, “Daniel has always been the more dedicated and talented one. He will excel in this program like no one else.” Meanwhile, Daniel had the same idea as his older brother. He believed that his brother was the more ideal and deserving candidate. He also decided to visit and speak to the committee.
Not long after James had left, Daniel showed up at the selection committee and advocated for his brother, saying “James’ leadership and vision make him the perfect choice. He deserves this chance more than I do.” Moved by their selflessness, the committee made an exception by selecting both brothers in the same year, for the first time in its history. Their story inspired others, showing that true success lies not only in individual achievements but also in supporting and encouraging others."

We go through life in fear and trembling, fearing what may happen, while hoping for the best. Most of us get anxious in the face of an indeterminate or ambiguous situation. We don’t handle uncertainty very well. We are easily tempted to settle for quick “solutions,” in order to eliminate our anxiety and doubt, even though these quick fixes may not, in the long run, actually be adequate solutions. It is natural, therefore, and even somewhat necessary, for us to seek stability in a sea of change and indeterminacy. We want a fixed star to guide us on our journey through hazardous waters.

This is because the brain has something of a two-tier memory system at work when it comes to retrieving memories, and this gives rise to a common yet infuriating sensation: recognising someone, but not being able to remember how or why, or what their name is. This happens because the brain differentiates between familiarity and recall. To clarify, familiarity (or recognition) is when you encounter someone or something and you know you've done so before. But beyond that, you've got nothing; all you can say is this person/thing is already in your memories. Recall is when you can access the original memory of how and why you know this person; recognition is just flagging up the fact that the memory exists."

Only when you start to learn the practice of science do you realize that each of these “facts” was hard won through a succession of logical inferences based upon many observations or experiments. The process of science is less about collecting pieces of knowledge than it is about reducing the uncertainties in what we know. Our uncertainties can be greater or lesser for any given piece of knowledge depending upon where we are in that process —today we are quite certain of how an apple will fall from a tree, but our understanding of the turbulent fluid flow remains a work in progress after more than a century of effort."

But when tech lobbyists speak of self-regulation, they are not describing it as it is understood by professionals like doctors. Unlike in medicine, there are no mandatory ethical qualifications for working as a software engineer or technology executive. There is no enforceable industry code of conduct. There is no obligatory certification. There is no duty to put the public ahead of profit. There are few consequences for serious moral failings; no real fear of being suspended or struck off. Recent years have seen an explosion of AI ethics charters and the like, filled with well-meaning generalities about the responsible use of powerful computers. But without consequences for violating them, these charters are just toothless statements of aspiration. The tech industry is basically saying: trust us. But blind trust is not how we govern doctors, lawyers, bankers, pilots or anyone else in unelected positions of social responsibility. Tech is the exception, and it’s not clear why."

He illustrates it with the example of someone looking through a keyhole who suddenly finds himself caught by someone watching him. The look of the other is always unnerving, Sartre argues, not only because we momentarily recognize ourselves in it through our imagination of their judgment of us but also because we don’t. We can always step back, challenge our perception of others’ perceptions of ourselves, or explain them away — but we don’t know what these perceptions really are. Others have the distinctive power of making us feel judged in ways we cannot fully control.

Such sequences suggest the startling notion that our hands “know” what we’re going to say before our conscious minds do, and in fact this is often the case. Gesture can mentally prime a word so that the right term comes to our lips. When people are prevented from gesturing, they talk less fluently; their speech becomes halting because their hands are no longer able to supply them with the next word, and the next. Not being able to gesture has other deleterious effects: without gesture to help our mental processes along, we remember less useful information, we solve problems less well, and we are less able to explain our thinking. Far from tagging along as speech’s clumsy companion, gesture represents the leading edge of our thought."

It’s about using gestures to complement your spoken messages, adding layers of meaning to your words. Open-handed gestures, for example, can indicate honesty, creating an atmosphere of trust. You invite openness and collaboration when you speak with your palms facing up. This simple yet powerful gesture can make others feel more comfortable and willing to engage in conversation. But be careful of the trap of over-gesturing. Too many hand movements can distract from your message, drawing attention away from your words. Imagine a speaker whose hands move quickly like birds, their message lost in the chaos of their gestures. Balance is key. Your gestures should highlight your words, not overshadow them."

Kids younger than six or seven usually say that the tall narrow glass now holds more water, because the level is higher. And when they are ready, they figure out the conservation of volume for themselves just by playing with cups of water. Piaget argued that children’s understanding of morality is like their understanding of those water glasses: we can’t say that it is innate or kids learn it directly from adults. Rather, it is self-constructed as kids play with other kids. Taking turns in a game is like pouring water back and forth between glasses. Once kids have reached the age of five or six, then playing games and working things out together will help them learn about fairness far more effectively than any teaching from adults."

In artistic and entertainment descriptions, it’s essential for the author to establish a positive relationship between a protagonist and the audience. In order for tragedy or misfortune to draw out an emotional response in viewers, the character must be adjusted so as to be recognizable as either friend or enemy. Whether the portrayal is fictional or documentary, we must feel that the protagonist is someone whose actions benefit us; the protagonist is, or would be, a worthy companion or valued ally. Violent action films are often filled with dozens of incidental deaths of minor characters that draw out little response in the audience. In order to feel strong emotions, the audience must be emotionally invested in a character as either ally or enemy."

We all view ourselves similar to the blindfolded statue of Lady Justice evaluating competing claims without bias, emotions, or motivations. And yet, overwhelming psychological research suggests that such unbiased rationality is actually a fairly elusive quality in humans. Much of the time people are on automatic pilot. In other words, individuals are acting without reflection more often than they are thinking carefully and deliberately. The rest of the time, even as individuals are trying their best to think through issues, motivational goals may bias their thought processes and bias their reasoning. Ziva Kunda, who coined the term “motivated reasoning” to describe this phenomenon, explained that although individuals try to make well-thought-out decisions, use available evidence, and look at both sides of an issue, the process is often tainted by motivations that may be unknown to them. Individuals’ motivations may direct them to attend more carefully to some information while ignoring other relevant facts. Or they may use different strategies to evaluate information they prefer to be correct while at the same time being hypercritical of flaws in information they prefer to be wrong."

In spite of professional standards, claims of objectivity, and the peer review process, the conduct of science can be biased. All experts are not the same, nor do they submit their work to the same scrutiny. Knowing the source of funding can be important in evaluating scientific claims. For example, the Harvard researchers who made claims in the late 1960s about the problems with dietary fat, leading the nation away from perceiving sugar as one of the main causes in health problems, were funded in part by the sugar industry. The authors did not reveal their funding source to the New England Journal of Medicine, where their influential article appeared. Their article shaped a generation of changes in eating patterns that appears to have fostered higher use of sugar, now widely implicated as a source of the rise in obesity and diabetes.

A human programmer must have composed the first algorithm that, in turn, generates new algorithms and as such the initial programmer must be in control of the original idea. However, this is not necessarily true. Unlike humanly conceived ideas, where the author is the intellectual owner of the idea, algorithms are processes that define, describe, and implement a series of actions that in turn produce other actions. During the transfer of actions it is possible for a discrepancy to occur between the original intention and the actual result. If that happens then, by definition, the author of the algorithm is not in control of, and therefore does not own intellectually from that point on, the resulting process. Theoretically, ownership of an idea is intrinsically connected to the predictability of its outcome, that is, to its intellectual control. Therefore, in the absence of human control the ownership of the algorithmic process must be instead credited to the device that produced it, that is, to the computer."

He regarded the whole system of science and philosophy as we today regard science alone; he felt that the metaphysical principles were ultimately justified by their “fruits,” not merely by their self-evidence. What we today call applied science consisted for him not only in mechanics but also in medicine and ethics. The difficulty was that from the general principles of Cartesian or Aristotelian science-philosophy no results could be derived which were precisely in agreement with observation, but these principles seemed to be intelligible and plausible. So the tree was cut in the middle. For the derivation of technical results, it was necessary to start from the physical principles in the trunk. Science in the new sense was to think only of how the fruits would develop from the trunk without regard to the roots."

Both are also fairly systematic. Although many people believe that art is by definition wild and intuitive, while only science is methodologically disciplined, there is a great deal of evidence — including from artists talking about their own practices — to suggest that art is often created methodically and systematically, and that frameworks and forms permit creativity to flow. Instead of being liberating, freedom without limits is almost paralysing, because without frameworks we end up in a vacuum in which our actions generate no response. As the Danish poet and filmmaker Jørgen Leth has put it many times, ‘the rules of the game’ are a prerequisite for artistic freedom. They provide a solid form or structure that enables the artist to make use of ‘the gifts of chance’ (to use Leth’s expression), and in which a part of the world can be exhibited in a nonchaotic manner. In order to create beauty, the artist must restrict him- or herself."

This fact intrigues scientists, because it would seem actually to be a considerable obstacle: imagine, for example, the classic war movie scene where the soldier dresses in camouflage and paints his face with green and brown color — but can do nothing about his noticeably white sclera, beaming bright against the jungle. There must be some reason humans developed it, despite its obvious costs. In fact, the advantage of visible sclera —so goes the “cooperative eye hypothesis” — is precisely that it enables humans to see clearly, and from a distance, which direction other humans are looking. Michael Tomasello showed in a 2007 study that chimpanzees, gorillas, and bonobos —our nearest cousins —follow the direction of each other’s heads, whereas human infants follow the direction of each other’s eyes. So the value of looking someone in the eye may in fact be something uniquely human."

We can imagine, for instance, a squirrel who is planning how to get from the branch she’s currently standing on to a branch from the tree in front. To do this, in principle she doesn’t need a concept of branch nor a concept of tree. It might be enough for her to have, for example, the ability to think in images; to make a mental map of the tree where she can imagine and try out different routes. This doesn’t imply that squirrels lack concepts, simply that they don’t need them for this concrete form of thinking.

We know that when we’re emotionally stimulated — stressed, sad, any intense emotion, really — our bodies sweat a tiny bit, so little we might not even notice. And when those tiny drops of sweat appear, our skin gets more electrically conductive. This change in sweat gland activity happens completely without your conscious mind having much say in the matter. If you feel emotionally intense, you’re going to notice an increase in sweat gland activity. This is particularly useful from a scientific viewpoint, because it allows us to put an objective value on a subjective state of mind. We can actually measure your emotional state by tracking how your body subconsciously sweats, by running a bit of electricity through your skin. We can then turn the subjective, subconscious experience of emotional intensity into an objective number by figuring out how good your skin gets at transferring an electrical current."

Newton is a prime example: beyond the Newtonian mechanics, he developed the theory of gravitation, calculus, laws of motion, and optimization. In fact, well-known scientists are often involved in multiple discoveries, a phenomenon potentially explained by the Matthew effect. Indeed, an initial success may offer a scientist legitimacy, improve peer perception, provide knowledge of how to score and win, enhance social status, and attract resources and quality collaborators, each of these payoffs further increasing her odds of scoring another win. Yet, there is an appealing alternative explanation: Great scientists have multiple hits and consistently succeed in their scientific endeavors simply because they’re exceptionally talented. Therefore, future success again goes to those who have had success earlier, not because of advantages offered by the previous success, but because the earlier success was indicative of a hidden talent. The Matthew effect posits that success alone increases the future probability of success, raising the question: Does status dictate outcomes, or does it simply reflect an underlying talent or quality? In other words, is there really a Matthew effect after all?"

Each of these issues has been addressed through humour in a way that has helped to make more progressive values more acceptable than previously. Often a character, usually someone marked as a bigot, resisted one or more of these developments and was then made to appear ridiculous. They were cut down either through their own stupidity, a brief scolding from others, or both. In this way, the humour of sitcoms acted as a cost-effective means to encourage acceptance of a more pluralistic and tolerant society."

They oriented buildings to capture cool breezes and block the worst heat of the afternoon. They built with thick walls and white roofs and transoms over doors to encourage airflow. Anyone who has ever spent a few minutes in a mudbrick house in Tucson, or walked on the narrow streets of old Seville, knows how well these construction methods work.

The cartilage in your left knee then “drinks in” synovial fluid, in much the same way that a sponge soaks up liquid when put in water.

Each generation of artists learned techniques and continued the work of previous ones, preserving and improving what their predecessors had worked on.

However, when we need to deal with new information, ideas, and viewpoints, linear thinking will often come up short.

The garden is a small ecosystem that the grower attempts to keep in a specific state, namely the maximization of fruit and vegetable production. To achieve this, the grower is almost always intervening in the dynamics of the ecosystem; they remove unwanted plants that begin to grow and perhaps spray insecticides and fence off the patch to stop insects and other animals from consuming the vegetables. Since maximizing vegetable growth is an inherently unstable state for the ecosystem, the grower is effectively keeping the ball on a slope. If the grower stops intervening, even for a day, the ecosystem, that small patch of ground, will naturally begin to shift to a more stable state. Vegetables may still grow, but yield will almost certainly be lower as other plants crowd out the vegetables and wildlife consume the produce."

The dependence on certainty all those millennia ago ensured our survival to the present day, and the danger‐alert system continues to protect us. This is achieved by our brains labeling new, vague, or unpredictable everyday events and experiences as uncertain.

Such a thing would occur, for example, if I could somehow share your memories: I would have a memory-type experience, but this would not be of something that I had actually experienced.

In other words, a dictionary functions in many cases as a cross-reference or translator between words one knows and words that one doesn’t yet know.

As a result, when dealing with opposing viewpoints, being a bit more indirect can often be more effective. Rather than starting with information, start by encouraging people to be more open minded and receptive. This is why expressing doubt can help. Showing that we’re conflicted or uncertain makes us seem less threatening. Expressing doubt about one’s own view acknowledges that conflicting beliefs are valid, making the other side feel validated and more willing to listen. It recognizes that issues are complicated or nuanced, which increases receptiveness. Uncertainty signals an openness to other perspectives.

Finally, putting aside the many ways in which statistical results can be manipulated, there are ways in which turning people’s lives into numbers is morally insulating. Statistics on crime, homelessness, or the spread of a disease say nothing of people’s suffering. We read the statistics as reports on events at a distance, thus allowing us to escape without being disturbed. Statistics are human beings with the tears wiped off. Quantify with caution."

The languages of socially subordinated groups may from quite an early period of contact provide terminology for objects or practices with which speakers of the more powerful group were previously unfamiliar, but the effects of contact in that direction may not progress any further than this. In some cases, as with the Dharug language of Sydney, Australia, the source of some of the earliest loans from Indigenous Australian languages into English, the fate of the language system is extinction after the obliteration of many of its speakers. The remainder shifted to varieties of English, the language of the people who had suppressed them."

She did not know how much longer she could hang on, but then Anna glanced up and couldn't believe what she saw. A fishing boat was approaching over the big waves.

As such, learners need to be given the freedom and autonomy to assume responsibility for their own choices and to be proactive in making decisions that contribute to their educational experiences. Rather than perform the role of the ""sage on the stage,"" in working with adult learners, the instructor's role should be the ""guide on the side"" — a facilitator of learning, and a coach or mentor who works alongside their learners to promote achievement and academic success. The facilitator role extends beyond course delivery, and includes the broader pedagogical tasks that will support learners on their growth such as helping them effectively manage their time; fostering engagement; assigning meaningful and relevant learning activities; and so on."

It is true of your social perceptions as well — your perceptions of the people you meet, the food you eat, and even of the products you buy. For example, in a study of wine, when wines were tasted blind, there was little or no correlation between the ratings of a wine's taste and its cost, but there was a significant correlation when the wines were labeled by price. That wasn't because the subjects consciously believed that the higher-priced wines should be the better ones and thus revised whatever opinion they had accordingly. Or rather, it wasn't true just at the conscious level. We know because as the subjects were tasting the wine, the researchers were imaging their brain activity, and the imaging showed that drinking what they believed was an expensive glass of wine really did activate their centers of taste for pleasure more than drinking a glass of the same wine that had been labeled as cheaper. That's related to the placebo effect. Like pain, taste is not just the product of sensory signals; it depends also on psychological factors: you don't just taste the wine; you taste its price."

The likelihood of being rattled by curse words or taboo words changes across native and second languages. Speakers of multiple languages not only report feeling different, but their bodies have different physiological reactions and their minds make different emotionally driven decisions across languages. The exact relationship between positive and negative emotions and language varies across people. For some, the second language carries more positive connotations because it is associated with freedom, opportunity, financial well-being and escape from persecution, whereas the native language is associated with poverty and hardship. For others, the opposite is true — the second language is associated with post-immigration challenges, discrimination and lack of close relationships, whereas the native language is associated with family, friends and parental love. And many are somewhere in between, having a mix of positive and negative experiences associated with each language."

In 1921, he and his family left Russia, eventually settling in Belgium. His parents encouraged him to become a lawyer, and he first studied law at the Free University of Brussels. It was then that he became interested in psychology and behavioral research. In turn, reading about these subjects sparked his interest in chemistry since chemical processes affect the mind and body. He eventually dropped out of law school. Prigogine then studied chemistry and physics at the same time at the Free University of Brussels. He obtained the equivalent of a master's degree in both fields in 1939, and he obtained a PhD in chemistry in 1941 at the Free University of Brussels, where he accepted the position of professor in 1947.

It offers opportunities for new learning and growth. Being ""uprooted"" from our home brings us understanding not only of the people and their culture in our new environment, but of ourselves and our home culture. Although the difficulties that can arise from crossing cultures are often shocking, success stories are everywhere. Despite, or rather because of, the suffering and ambivalence we undergo when we cross cultures, we gradually find ourselves uniquely privileged to define ourselves and others anew with clarity and insight that we could not have cultivated without leaving home. Adapting to a new and unfamiliar culture, then, is more than survival. It is a life-changing journey. It is a process of ""becoming"" — personal reinvention, transformation, growth, reaching out beyond the boundaries of our own existence. The process does not require that we abandon our former personalities and the cultures into which we were born. Rather, it compels us to find ourselves as if for the first time, particularly those ""cultural invariants"" within us—aspects that we hold dear and refuse to compromise."

Although, in a small room, children failed to incorporate information about nongeometric features (i.e., a blue wall), they used both types of information in a larger room. These findings suggest that geometric and nongeometric information may be combined in a weighted fashion. Geometry may be privileged because it is more stable across time than is nongeometric information. Whether or not nongeometric landmark information is combined with geometry may depend on the ecological validity of nongeometric features; for example, larger features may be more stable and hence more  reliable. Further, a variety of mobile animals give more weight to nearer than to farther landmarks in estimation, consistent with Weber's law in which smaller distances would be coded more accurately than larger distances."

There is considerable improvement in handwriting skills. We gain mastery over the mechanics of language. We also gradually eliminate the logical gaps in our stories — characteristic of our earlier stage of perception — as intense preoccupation with the whole vision gives way to preoccupation with correctness. As a result, our writing and oral storying become increasingly conventional and literal, with an accompanying loss of the spontaneity and originality that characterized our earlier efforts. At this stage our vocabulary is firmly grounded. We use words everyone else uses. We have little need to invent metaphors to communicate. By now we know that a star is ""a hot gaseous mass floating in space"" in contrast to our innocent stage, when we noticed, ""Look that star is like a flower without a stem!"""

We tend to get offended when someone else or society determines for us how much of what we have should be given away; we are adults and should have the right to make such decisions for ourselves. Yet, when interviewed, altruists known for making the largest sacrifices — and bringing about the greatest benefits to their recipients — assert just the opposite. They insist that they had absolutely no choice but to act as they did. Organ donors, and everyday citizens who risk their own lives to save others in mortal danger are remarkably consistent in their explicit denials that they have done anything deserving of high praise as well as in their assurance that anyone in their shoes should have done exactly the same thing. To be sure, it seems that the more altruistic someone is, the more they are likely to insist that they have done no more than all of us would be expected to do, lest we shirk our basic moral obligation to humanity."

If you depend on no one except yourself to satisfy your desires, you will have no master other than yourself and you will be free. Stoic philosophy was about that — taking charge of your life, learning to work on those things that are within your power to accomplish or change and not to waste energy on things you cannot. In particular, the Stoics warned against reacting emotionally to what is outside your control. Often, Epictetus argued, it's not our circumstances that get us down but rather the judgments we make about them. Consider anger. We don't get angry at the rain if it spoils our picnic. That would be silly because we can't do anything about the rain. But we often do get angry if someone mistreats us. We usually can't control or change that person any more than we can stop the rain, so that is equally silly. More generally, it is just as pointless to tie our feelings of well-being to altering another individual's behavior as it is to tie them to the weather.

In the modern language, however, ao has come to be restricted mostly to blue shades, and green is usually expressed by the word midori. When the first traffic lights were imported from the United States and installed in Japan in the 1930s, they were just as green as anywhere else. Nevertheless, in common parlance the go light was called ao shingoo, perhaps because the three primary colors on Japanese artists' palettes are traditionally aka(red), kiiro(yellow), and ao. The label ao for a green light did not appear so out of the ordinary at first, because of the remaining associations of the word ao with greenness. But over time, the difference between the green color and the dominant meaning of the word ao began to feel awkward. Nations that are less assertive might have opted for the solution of simply changing the official name of the go light to midori. Not so the Japanese. Rather than alter the name to fit reality, the Japanese government announced in 1973 that reality should be altered to fit the name: henceforth, go lights would be a color that better corresponded to the dominant meaning of ao."

To address such disparities, Horner, Lu, Royster, and Trimbur (2011) call for a ""translingual approach"" in which language varieties are not perceived as barriers, but as avenues for meaning making. Similarly, Galloway and Rose (2015) study of Global Englishes found that exposure to other Englishes helps normalize language differences. Educators have to work with students to examine phrases, expressions, and other ranges of English language use for their rhetorical and communicative possibilities and not their perceived errors or inferior status. After all, students are constantly reading texts and listening to speakers whose Englishes do not necessarily conform to what is considered standard in their own communities."

In music, for example, at one end of the creative spectrum are improvisational artists, such as jazz musicians. They have to be particularly talented at lowering their inhibitions and letting in their unconsciously generated ideas. And although the process of learning the fundamentals of jazz would require a high degree of analytical thought, that thinking style is not as big a factor during the performance. On the other end of the spectrum are those who compose complex forms, such as a symphony or concerto, that require not just imagination but also careful planning and exacting editing. We know, for example, through his letters and the reports of others, that even Mozart's creations did not appear spontaneously, wholly formed in his consciousness, as the myths about him portray. Instead, he spent long, hard hours analyzing and reworking the ideas that arose in his unconscious, much as a scientist does when producing a theory from a germ of insight.

However, the role of social justice in these approaches remains highly controversial. For example, Landscape Urbanism is a relatively recent planning approach that advocates for native habitat designs that include diverse species and landscapes that require very low resource use. However, critics claim that Landscape Urbanists prioritize aesthetic and ecological concerns over human needs. In contrast, New Urbanism is an approach that was popularized in the 1980s and promotes walkable streets, compact design, and mixed-use developments. But Landscape Urbanists find that these designs do not prioritize the natural environment and often involve diverting streams and disrupting natural wetlands. Still others, such as those advocating for ""just sustainabilities"" or ""complete streets,"" find that both approaches are overly idealistic and neither pays enough attention to the realities of social dynamics and systemic inequality."

They calculate risks thoroughly, carefully picking and choosing the customers they insure. They are boring because their role in the economy is to shield everyone and everything from disastrous loss. Unlike manufacturing, nothing truly revolutionary ever happens in the insurance industry. For centuries, insurers have charged higher premiums to people in ""high-risk categories"" such as smokers, male drivers under the age of thirty, and extreme-sports enthusiasts. This type of classification frequently results in biases and outright discrimination against disadvantaged groups. But in the future, real-time data collection will enable insurance companies to charge pay-as-you-drive rates depending on people's actual behavior on the road, as opposed to generalized stereotypes of certain ""at-risk"" groups. Bad or high-risk individual drivers will end up paying more for insurance, regardless of whether they are men or women, young or old. The Big Brother connotations are threatening, but many people might agree to the real-time monitoring of their driving behavior if it means lower rates."

They present foreshortened figures and objects that diminish as they move away from the focal point of the painting. A painting in perspective represents how the world looks to a person seeing the scene from a particular position in space. This stands in contrast to earlier figurative art, which had been as focused on representing what the artist knew about the objects and the space he or she was painting as on how they looked. These pictures are beautiful in their own right, but they do not represent scenes as we might see them if we were looking at them. They are also less informative as to the layout of the space they represent. The fact that perspective and information about spatial layout go together reveals something important about seeing. Not only do we see the world through an egocentric frame but we also see it in a way that allows us to extract information about distances to, and sizes of, objects relative to us, and relative to one another."

Whether intentionally or not, ""plasticity"" suggests that the key idea is to mold something once and keep it that way forever: to shape the plastic toy and never change it again. But that's not what the brain does. It carries on remolding itself throughout your life. Think of a developing city, and note the way it grows, improves, and responds to the world around it. Observe where the city builds its truck stops, how it crafts its immigration policies, and how it modifies its education and legal systems. A city is always changing. A city is not designed by urban planners and then immobilized like a plastic object. It continually develops. Just like cities, brains never reach an end point. We spend our lives blossoming toward something, even as the target moves. Consider the feeling of encountering a diary that you wrote many years ago. It represents the thinking, opinions, and viewpoint of someone who was a bit different from who you are now, and that previous person can sometimes border on the unrecognizable.

Tommy's grandfather, affectionately known as Grandpa Joe, had always been a mysterious figure to him. Grandpa Joe was a man of few words, but his eyes lit up from stories untold. One lazy summer afternoon, while searching the garage, Tommy found an old, forgotten box. As he opened it, the treasure of memories spilled out, including an old baseball card featuring a young Grandpa Joe.
Tommy's eyes widened with excitement as he examined the card. In the card, Grandpa Joe stood proudly in a baseball uniform. He was not the quiet person Tommy knew. Intrigued by this discovery, Tommy rushed inside the house to find Grandpa Joe. ""Hey, Grandpa! I found this cool baseball card of you. Were you a baseball player?"" he asked, eyes filled with curiosity.
A spark of nostalgia lit up Grandpa Joe's eyes as he took the card. Memories flooded back, and he told stories of his youthful days on the baseball field. Grandpa Joe spoke of the thrill of the game and the joy of hitting a home run. Tommy, fascinated by these stories, felt more connected to his grandfather. Eager to learn more, he asked Grandpa Joe to teach him about baseball.
They spent afternoons in the backyard as he shared the wisdom of the game with his grandson. Together, they practiced hitting, catching, and even laughed over the mistakes. As they bonded over baseball, the gap between generations closed. Grandpa Joe's eyes no longer held just the twinkle of untold stories; they now radiated warmth and shared memories."

But does that mean the entire concept of the self-driving car is not worth pursuing? No, it only means that at the time we did not yet have the tools we now possess to help enable vehicles to operate both autonomously and safely. This once-distant dream now seems within our reach. It is much the same story in medicine. Two decades ago, we were still taping bricks to accelerators. Today, we are approaching the point where we can begin to bring some appropriate technology to bear in ways that advance our understanding of patients as unique individuals.

Dorothy and her three friends work hard to get to the Emerald City, overcoming barriers, persisting against all adversaries. They do so because they expect the Wizard to give them what they are missing. Instead, the wonderful (and wise) Wizard makes them aware that they, not he, always had the power to fulfill their wishes. For Dorothy, home is not a place but a feeling of security, of comfort with people she loves; it is wherever her heart is. The courage the Lion wants, the intelligence the Scarecrow longs for, and the emotions the Tin Man dreams of are attributes they already possess. They need to think about these attributes not as internal conditions but as positive ways in which they are already relating to others. After all, didn't they demonstrate those qualities on the journey to Oz, a journey motivated by little more than an expectation, an idea about the future likelihood of getting something they wanted?"

This, more than values and attitudes, is the part of personality that is easiest to change. Ingestive habits such as smoking, drinking, and various eating behaviors are the most common health concerns targeted for behavioral changes. Process-addiction behaviors (workaholism, shopaholism, and the like) fall into this category as well. Mental imagery combined with power of suggestion was taken up as the premise of behavioral medicine to help people change negative health behaviors into positive ones. Although this technique alone will not produce changes, when used alongside other behavior modification tactics and coping strategies, behavioral changes have proved effective for some people. What mental imagery does is reinforce a new desired behavior. Repeated use of images reinforces the desired behavior more strongly over time."

Although extra-familial influences, such as peers or media, gain in importance during adolescence, parents remain the primary socialization agents. For example, their own responses to emotional situations serve as a role model for emotion regulation, increasing the likelihood that their children will show similar reactions in comparable situations. Parental practices at times when their children are faced with emotional challenges also impact emotion regulation development. Whereas direct soothing and directive guidance of what to do are beneficial for younger children, they may intrude on adolescents' autonomy striving. In consequence, adolescents might pull away from, rather than turn toward, their parents in times of emotional crisis, unless parental practices are adjusted. More suitable in adolescence is indirect support of autonomous emotion regulation, such as through interest in, as well as awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of, adolescents' emotional experiences, and being available when the adolescent wants to talk."

But that push is misguided if it is directed toward accomplishing something physically impossible.

That may be impossible no matter how strong the dancer is. But a short-footed dancer may have no trouble! Another dancer may be struggling to complete a half-turn in the air. Understanding the connection between a rapid turn rate and the alignment of the body close to the rotation axis tells her how to accomplish her turn successfully. In both of these cases, understanding and working within the constraints imposed by nature and described by physical laws allows dancers to work efficiently, minimizing potential risk of injury."

The term ""children's film"" implies ownership by children — their cinema — but films supposedly made for children have always been consumed by audiences of all ages, particularly in commercial cinemas. The considerable crossover in audience composition for children's films can be shown by the fact that, in 2007, eleven Danish children's and youth films attracted 59 per cent of theatrical admissions, and in 2014, German children's films comprised seven out of the top twenty films at the national box office. This phenomenon corresponds with a broader, international embrace of what is seemingly children's culture among audiences of diverse ages. The old prejudice that children's film is some other realm, separate from (and forever subordinate to) a more legitimate cinema for adults is not supported by the realities of consumption: children's film is at the heart of contemporary popular culture."

Our brains experience a sense of reward when we create something new in the process of exploring something uncertain, such as a musical phrase that we've never played or heard before. When our curiosity leads to something novel, the resulting reward brings us a sense of pleasure. A number of investigators have modeled how curiosity influences musical composition. In the case of Beethoven, computer modeling focused on the thirty-two piano sonatas written after age thirteen revealed that the musical patterns found in all of Beethoven's music decreased in later sonatas, while novel patterns, including patterns that were unique to a particular sonata, increased. In other words, Beethoven's music became less predictable over time as his curiosity drove the exploration of new musical ideas. Curiosity is a powerful driver of human creativity."

But simple metrics can take us further away from the important goals we really care about, which may require complicated metrics or be extremely difficult, or perhaps impossible, to reduce to any measure. And when we have imperfect or bad proxies, we can easily fall under the illusion that we are solving for a good end without actually making genuine progress toward a worthy solution.

Always new structure is based on old structure, and at every stage selection favors some cells and eliminates others. The survivors serve to produce new cells that undergo further rounds of selection. Except in the immune system, cells and extensions of cells are not genetically selected during development, but rather, are positionally selected. Those in the right place that make the right connections are stimulated, and those that don't are eliminated. This process is much like sculpting.

This, in the view of managers, has contributed to the resolution of the problem. The home care workers, on the other hand, may perceive their work not as a set of separate tasks to be performed as efficiently as possible, but as a service to be provided to a client with whom they may have developed a relationship. This includes having conversations with clients and enquiring about the person's well-being.

However, there are many lines of evidence to suggest that vagrancy can, on rare occasions, dramatically alter the fate of populations, species or even whole ecosystems. Despite being infrequent, these events can be extremely important when viewed at the timescales over which ecological and evolutionary processes unfold. The most profound consequences of vagrancy relate to the establishment of new breeding sites, new migration routes and wintering locations.

As a result, data collected in large data repositories become ""data tombs""—data archives that are hardly visited. Important decisions are often made based not on the information-rich data stored in data repositories but rather on a decision maker's instinct, simply because the decision maker does not have the tools to extract the valuable knowledge hidden in the vast amounts of data. Efforts have been made to develop expert system and knowledge-based technologies, which typically rely on users or domain experts to manually input knowledge into knowledge bases. However, this procedure is likely to cause biases and errors and is extremely costly and time consuming. The widening gap between data and information calls for the systematic development of tools that can turn data tombs into ""golden nuggets"" of knowledge."

I am John Austin, a science teacher at Crestville High School. Recently I was impressed by the latest book you wrote about the environment. Also my students read your book and had a class discussion about it. They are big fans of your book, so I'd like to ask you to visit our school and give a special lecture. We can set the date and time to suit your schedule. Having you at our school would be a fantastic experience for the students. We would be very grateful if you could come.
Best regards,

She ran to Marilyn, saying she would never build a sandcastle again. Marilyn said, ""Part of the joy of building a sandcastle is that, in the end, we give it as a gift to the ocean."" Sarah loved this idea and responded with enthusiasm to the idea of building another castle—this time, even closer to the water so the ocean would get its gift sooner!"

Just change the challenge statement into positive statements. Let me give you an example here. If you struggle with getting up early in the morning, then write a positive statement such as ""I get up early in the morning at 5:00 am every day."" Once you write these statements, get ready to witness magic and confidence. You will be surprised that just by writing these statements, there is a shift in the way you think and act.

They were all young men and especially good runners who watched the road in both directions. If they caught sight of another messenger coming, they hurried out to meet them. The Inca built the huts on high ground, in sight of one another. When a messenger neared the next hut, he began to call out and repeated the message three or four times to the one who was running out to meet him.

Around 2,370 years ago, Aristotle wrote that there are five, in both humans and animals—sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. However, according to the philosopher Fiona Macpherson, there are reasons to doubt it. For a start, Aristotle missed a few in humans: the perception of your own body which is different from touch and the sense of balance which has links to both touch and vision. Other animals have senses that are even harder to categorize. Many vertebrates have a different sense system for detecting odors. Some snakes can detect the body heat of their prey. These examples tell us that ""senses cannot be clearly divided into a limited number of specific kinds,"" Macpherson wrote in The Senses. Instead of trying to push animal senses into Aristotelian buckets, we should study them for what they are."

Those who have found deeper meaning in their careers find their days much more energizing and satisfying, and count their employment as one of their greatest sources of joy and pride. Sonya Lyubomirsky, professor of psychology at the University of California, has conducted numerous workplace studies showing that when people are more fulfilled on the job, they not only produce higher quality work and a greater output, but also generally earn higher incomes. Those most satisfied with their work are also much more likely to be happier with their lives overall. For her book Happiness at Work, researcher Jessica Pryce-Jones conducted a study of 3,000 workers in seventy-nine countries, finding that those who took greater satisfaction from their work were 150 percent more likely to have a happier life overall."

In evolutionary terms, human senses are adapted to the speed at which humans move through space under their own power while walking. Our ability to distinguish detail in the environment is therefore ideally suited to movement at speeds of perhaps five miles per hour and under. The fastest users of the street, motorists, therefore have a much more limited ability to process details along the street — a motorist simply has little time or ability to appreciate design details. On the other hand, pedestrian travel, being much slower, allows for the appreciation of environmental detail. Joggers and bicyclists fall somewhere in between these polar opposites; while they travel faster than pedestrians, their rate of speed is ordinarily much slower than that of the typical motorist."

When the climate changes, the places that satisfy those requirements change, too. Species are forced to follow. All creatures are capable of some degree of movement. Even creatures that appear immobile, like trees and barnacles, are capable of dispersal at some stage of their life—as a seed, in the case of the tree, or as a larva, in the case of the barnacle. A creature must get from the place it is born—often occupied by its parent—to a place where it can survive, grow, and reproduce. From fossils, scientists know that even creatures like trees moved with surprising speed during past periods of climate change."

Some visual information apparently gets in, but it is not normally processed as it is shortened or weakened; same with the other sensing systems. Stimuli are registered but not processed normally and they fail to wake the individual. Perceptual disengagement probably serves the function of protecting sleep, so some authors do not count it as part of the definition of sleep itself. But as sleep would be impossible without it, it seems essential to its definition. Nevertheless, many animals (including humans) use the intermediate state of drowsiness to derive some benefits of sleep without total perceptual disengagement."

Experts can become insensitive to how hard a task is for the beginner, an effect referred to as the 'curse of knowledge'. Dr Hinds was able to show that as people acquired the skill, they then began to underestimate the level of difficulty of that skill. Her participants even underestimated how long it had taken themselves to acquire that skill in an earlier session.

Common sense has prevailed: different sports have made adaptations for children. As examples, baseball has T ball, football has flag football and junior soccer uses a smaller and lighter ball and (sometimes) a smaller field.

In his dream, Iktomi, the great spirit and searcher of wisdom, appeared to him in the form of a spider. Iktomi spoke to him in a holy language.
Iktomi told Odawa about the cycles of life. He said, ""We all begin our lives as babies, move on to childhood, and then to adulthood. Finally, we come to old age, where we must be taken care of as babies again."" Iktomi also told him that there are good and bad forces in each stage of life. ""If we listen to the good forces, they will guide us in the right direction. But if we listen to the bad forces, they will lead us the wrong way and may harm us,"" Iktomi said.
When Iktomi finished speaking, he spun a web and gave it to Odawa. He said to Odawa, ""The web is a perfect circle with a hole in the center. Use the web to help your people reach their goals. Make good use of their ideas, dreams, and visions. If you believe in the great spirit, the web will catch your good ideas and the bad ones will go through the hole."" Right after Odawa woke up, he went back to his village.
Odawa shared Iktomi's lesson with his people. Today, many Native Americans have dream catchers hanging above their beds. Dream catchers are believed to filter out bad dreams. The good dreams are captured in the web of life and carried with the people. The bad dreams pass through the hole in the web and are no longer a part of their lives."

The piece would run in the normal 800-1,200 word range with photographs available of Taylor and Morganic's operation. Thank you for your consideration of this article. I hope to hear from you soon."

He had a firm belief that he could get a medal in the 200m. Swimming was dominated by Americans at the time, so Mark was dreaming of becoming a national hero for his country, Britain. That day, Mark was competing in his very last race—the final round of the 200m. He had done his training and was ready. One minute and fifty seconds later, it was all over. He had tried hard and, at his best, was ranked number four. He fell short of a bronze medal by 0.49 of a second. And that was the end of Mark's swimming career. He was heartbroken. He had nothing left."

When we argue, we exchange and examine reasons with a view toward believing what our best reasons say we should believe; sometimes we discover that our current reasons fall short, and that our beliefs are not well supported after all. Or sometimes we discover that a belief that we had dismissed as silly or obviously false in fact enjoys the support of highly compelling reasons. On other occasions, we discover that the reasons offered by those with whom we disagree measure up toe-to-toe with our own reasons. In any of these situations, an adjustment in our belief is called for; we must change what we believe, or revise it, or replace it, or suspend belief altogether."

If, thanks to endless chat and intrigue, the world knows that you are a good, charitable guy, then you boost your chance of being helped by someone else at some future date. The converse is also the case. I am less likely to get my back scratched, in the form of a favor, if it becomes known that I never scratch anybody else's. Indirect reciprocity now means something like ""If I scratch your back, my good example will encourage others to do the same and, with luck, someone will scratch mine."" By the same token, our behavior is endlessly shaped by the possibility that somebody else might be watching us or might find out what we have done. We are often troubled by the thought of what others may think of our deeds. In this way, our actions have consequences that go far beyond any individual act of charity, or indeed any act of mean-spirited malice. We all behave differently when we know we live in the shadow of the future. That shadow is cast by our actions because there is always the possibility that others will find out what we have done."

The psychologist Gerald L. Clore has spent decades performing clever experiments to better understand how people make decisions every day based on gut feelings. This phenomenon is called affective realism, because we experience supposed facts about the world that are created in part by our feelings. For example, people report more happiness and life satisfaction on sunny days, but only when they are not explicitly asked about the weather. When you apply for a job or college or medical school, make sure you interview on a sunny day, because interviewers tend to rate applicants more negatively when it is rainy. And the next time a good friend snaps at you, remember affective realism. Maybe your friend is irritated with you, but perhaps she didn't sleep well last night, or maybe it's just lunchtime. The change in her body budget, which she's experiencing as affect, might not have anything to do with you."

The continual patter we carry on in our heads is in fact a kind of internalized conversation. Likewise, many of the written forms we encounter at school and at work — from exams and evaluations, to profiles and case studies, to essays and proposals — are really social exchanges (questions, stories, arguments) put on paper and addressed to some imagined listener or interlocutor. There are significant advantages to turning such interactions at a remove back into actual social encounters. Research demonstrates that the brain processes the ""same"" information differently, and often more effectively, when other human beings are involved—whether we're imitating them, debating them, exchanging stories with them, synchronizing and cooperating with them, teaching or being taught by them. We are inherently social creatures, and our thinking benefits from bringing other people into our train of thought."

This is usually in very small amounts or in very dispersed environments. Virtually all of that energy is lost to the local environment, and historically there have been no efforts to gather it. It may seem odd to consider finding ways to ""collect"" energy that is given off all around us—by people simply walking or by walking upstairs and downstairs or by riding stationary/exercise bicycles, for example — but that is the general idea and nature of energy harvesting. The broad idea of energy harvesting is that there are many places at which small amounts of energy are generated—and often wasted— and when collected, this can be put to some practical use. Current efforts have begun, aimed at collecting such energy in smaller devices which can store it, such as portable batteries."

This book and similar research papers in the 1930s helped lay the early foundation for population ecology and indeed fostered the introduction of mathematics into the historical development of ecology. In ecology, Gause's contributions are equally acknowledged along with those of other early ecologists who studied population dynamics. However, most ecologists are not aware that Gause eventually went on to conduct very important research on antibiotics and somewhat left ecology behind.

This science was not exactly like our science today, but it was surely antecedent to it and was nonetheless an activity aimed at knowing about the world. Muslim rulers granted scientific institutions tremendous resources, such as libraries, observatories, and hospitals. Great schools in all the cities covering the Arabic Near East and Northern Africa (and even into Spain) trained generations of scholars. Almost every word in the modern scientific lexicon that begins with the prefix ""al"" owes its origins to Islamic science — algorithm, alchemy, alcohol, alkali, algebra. And then, just over 400 years after it started, it ground to an apparent halt, and it would be a few hundred years, give or take, before what we would today unmistakably recognize as science appeared in Europe—with Galileo, Kepler, and, a bit later, Newton."

If we are satisfied with our lives, we will not feel a burning desire to purchase anything, and then the economy may collapse. But if we are unsatisfied, and any of the products we buy actually delivers the promised lasting fulfillment, subsequent sales figures may likewise drop. We exist in a fog of messaging designed explicitly to influence our behavior. Not surprisingly, our behavior often shifts in precisely the manner intended. If you can be made to feel sufficiently inferior due to your yellowed teeth, perhaps you will rush to the pharmacy to purchase whitening strips. The lack of any research whatsoever correlating tooth shade with life satisfaction is never mentioned.

Hence, we are prone to becoming the blind leading the blind because our overemphasis on competition in nearly everything makes looking good more important than being good.

'The powers of the underworld allowed people to kill animals, provided people responded in certain ritual ways, such as taking fragments of animals into the caves and inserting them into the ""membrane"".' This is borne out in the San. Like other shamanistic societies, they have admiring practices between human hunters and their prey, suffused with taboos derived from extensive natural knowledge. These practices suggest that honouring may be one method of softening the disquiet of killing. It should be said that this disquiet needn't arise because there is something fundamentally wrong with a human killing another animal, but simply because we are aware of doing the killing. And perhaps, too, because in some sense we 'know' what we are killing. We make sound guesses that the pain and desire for life we feel—our worlds of experience—have a counterpart in the animal we kill. As predators, this can create problems for us. One way to smooth those edges, then, is to view that prey with respect."

Locke believed that our experience shapes who we are and who we become—and therefore he also believed that, given different experiences, human beings would have different characters. The influence of these ideas was profound, particularly for the new colonies in America, for example, because these were conscious attempts to make a new start and to form a new society. The new society was to operate on a different basis from that of European culture, which was based on the feudal system in which people's place in society was almost entirely determined by birth, and which therefore tended to emphasize innate characteristics. Locke's emphasis on the importance of experience in forming the human being provided an optimistic framework for those trying to form a different society."

It may, on the contrary, keep that prior work alive, giving it an afterlife it would never have had otherwise."" Hutcheon's refusal to see adaptation as ""vampiric"" is particularly inspiring for those of us who do work on adaptations. The idea of an ""afterlife"" of texts, of seeing what comes before as an inspiration for what comes now, is, by its very definition, keeping works ""alive."" Adaptations for young adults, in particular, have the added benefit of engaging the young adult reader with both then and now, past and present—functioning as both ""monuments"" to history and the ""flesh"" of the reader's lived experience. While this is true for adaptations in general, it is especially important for those written with young adults in mind. Such adaptations allow young readers to make personal connections with texts that might otherwise come across as old-fashioned or irrelevant."

However, he is quick to point out that this conclusion is still somewhat formal since different people have different views about what happiness is. Some people say it is worldly enjoyment while others say it is eternal salvation. Aristotle's theory will turn out to be ""naturalistic"" in that it does not depend on any theological or metaphysical knowledge. It does not depend on knowledge of God or of metaphysical and universal moral norms. It depends only on knowledge of human nature and other worldly and social realities.

This is often a very rational attribute to substitute — affect does convey useful signals as to the costs and benefits of outcomes. A problem sometimes arises, however, when affective valuation is not supplemented by any analytic processing and adjustment at all. For example, sole reliance on affective valuation can make people insensitive to probabilities and to quantitative features of the outcome that should effect decisions. One study demonstrated that people's evaluation of a situation where they might receive a shock is insensitive to the probability of receiving the shock because their thinking is swamped by affective evaluation of the situation. People were willing to pay almost as much to avoid a 1 percent probability of receiving a shock as they were to pay to avoid a 99 percent probability of receiving a shock. Clearly the affective reaction to the thought of receiving a shock was overwhelming the subjects' ability to evaluate the probabilities associated."

The linguistic resources we choose to use at particular communicative moments come to these moments with their conventionalized histories of meaning. It is their conventionality that binds us to some degree to particular ways of realizing our collective history.

Humans have a natural ability to build causal models of the world — that is, to explain why things happen — that AI systems still largely lack. For example, while a doctor can explain to a patient why a treatment works, referring to the changes it causes in the body, a modern machine-learning system could only tell you that patients who are given this treatment tend, on average, to get better. However, human reasoning is still notoriously prone to confusion and error when causal questions become sufficiently complex, such as when it comes to assessing the impact of policy interventions across society. In these cases, supporting human reasoning with more structured AI-based tools may be helpful. Researchers have been exploring the use of Bayesian Networks — an AI technology that can be used to map out the causal relationships between events, and to represent degrees of uncertainty around different areas — for decision support, such as to enable more accurate risk assessment. These may be particularly useful for assessing the threat of novel or rare threats, where little historical data is available, such as the risk of terrorist attacks and new ecological disasters."

Individuals became more free to live as they wished, and in ways that break away from social norms. In response, and because the high density of city living requires the pliant coordination of many thousands of people, urban societies have developed a wide range of methods to control urban behavior.

There lived a young boy named Nick. He would sing and whistle nearly all day. He was as merry as a lark. One day Nick went out taking a walk in the forest, at some distance from his home. When he reached a clear stream he felt very thirsty and bent down to drink water. But, just at that moment, he was suddenly seized and found himself in the hands of a fierce giant, a hundred times bigger than himself. For some time the giant held Nick in his big hands, and looked at him with great delight.
He then put him into a large bag, and carried him away. Poor Nick, who was in great fear, did all he could do to escape from his cruel captor. He tried to tear the bag, but the giant only laughed at him. At last, the giant came to his own house with a high wall all around it, and no trees, nor flowers. He put Nick into a prison. It was quite a dark room, with iron bars all around it.
Nick was very miserable, for he had never before been deprived of his liberty. He dashed backward and forward in his prison-house, but he could not escape. He thought of his own pleasant home, his companions, the sunlight, the trees, and the flowers. He screamed and tried to get out between the iron bars, but he only tore himself, and all in vain. In a moment, the giant came again to the prison.
He told Nick to sing, the same as he did when he was in his own home. ""Sing! sing! sing!"" said he, ""Why don't you sing?"" But Nick was too sad to sing. Who could sing in a prison! At length the giant grew very angry, and took Nick out of the prison to make him sing. He shook him, and then ordered him to sing. Nick felt terrified while missing whatever he enjoyed with freedom at his home. Now I will tell you who they were. Nick was a little bird and that giant was a cruel boy."

If you hate the thing you do but have to do it nonetheless, you have choice between hating the thing and accepting that it needs to be done. Either way you will do it. Doing it from place of hatred will develop hatred towards the self and others around you; doing it from the place of acceptance will create compassion towards the self and allow for opportunities to find a more suitable way of accomplishing the task. If you decide to accept the fact that your task has to be done, start from recognising that your situation is a gift from life; this will help you to see it as a lesson in acceptance."

If you want to get over an obstacle so that your idea can become the solution‐based policy you've long dreamed of, you can't have an all‐or‐nothing mentality. You have to be willing to alter your idea and let others influence its outcome. You have to be okay with the outcome being a little different, even a little less, than you wanted. Say you're pushing for a clean water act. Even if what emerges isn't as well‐funded as you wished, or doesn't match how you originally conceived the bill, you'll have still succeeded in ensuring that kids in troubled areas have access to clean water. That's what counts, that they will be safer because of your idea and your effort. Is it perfect? No. Is there more work to be done? Absolutely. But in almost every case, helping move the needle forward is vastly better than not helping at all."

Think about the person you knew who was once on the fast track at your company, who is either no longer with the firm or, worse yet, appears to have hit a plateau in his or her career. Assuming he or she did not make an ambitious move, more often than not, this individual is a victim of having failed to stay relevant and embrace the advances in his or her industry. Think about the impact personal computing technology had on the first wave of executive leadership exposed to the technology. Those who embraced the technology were able to integrate it into their work styles and excel. Those who were resistant many times found few opportunities to advance their careers and in many cases were ultimately let go through early retirement for failure to stay relevant and update their skills."

A few large studies have helped to shed some light. In one, higher fruit intake in older, cognitively healthy adults was linked with less volume in the hippocampus. This finding was unusual, since people who eat more fruit usually display the benefits associated with a healthy diet. In this study, however, the researchers isolated various components of the subjects' diets and found that fruit didn't seem to be doing their memory centers any favors. Another study from the Mayo Clinic saw a similar inverse relationship between fruit intake and volume of the cortex, the large outer layer of the brain. Researchers in the latter study noted that excessive consumption of high‐sugar fruit (such as mangoes, bananas, and pineapples) may cause metabolic and cognitive problems as much as processed carbs do."

It's a lot easier to move under the radar when no one knows you and no one is paying attention. You can mess up and be rough and get dirty because no one even knows you're there. But as soon as you start to win, and others start to notice, you're suddenly aware that you're being observed. You're being judged. You worry that others will discover your flaws and weaknesses, and you start hiding your true personality, so you can be a good role model and good citizen and a leader that others can respect. There is nothing wrong with that. But if you do it at the expense of being who you really are, making decisions that please others instead of pleasing yourself, you're not going to be in that position very long. When you start apologizing for who you are, you stop growing and you stop winning. Permanently."

In each age group except 12 to 13‐year‐olds, those who said they read books once a month or less accounted for the largest proportion. Of the 12 to 13‐year‐old group, 42% stated they read daily or several times a week, which was the highest share within that group. In the 14 to 15‐year‐old group, the percentage of teenagers who read daily or several times a week was twice higher than that of those who never read a book in the same age group.

Born in Calcutta, India, into a British family, Cameron was educated in France. Given a camera as a gift by her daughter in December 1863, she quickly and energetically devoted herself to the art of photography. She cleared out a chicken coop and converted it into studio space where she began to work as a photographer. Cameron made illustrative studio photographs, convincing friends and family members to pose for photographs, fitting them in theatrical costumes and carefully composing them into scenes. Criticized for her so‐called bad technique by art critics in her own time, she ignored convention and experimented with composition and focus. Later critics appreciated her valuing of spiritual depth over technical perfection and now consider her portraits to be among the finest expressions of the artistic possibilities of the medium."

Thus, in changing environments, it might be advantageous to combine human judgment and statistical models. Blattberg and Hoch examined this possibility by having supermarket managers forecast demand for certain products and then creating a composite forecast by averaging these judgments with the forecasts of statistical models based on past data. The logic was that statistical models assume stable conditions and therefore cannot account for the effects on demand of novel events such as actions taken by competitors or the introduction of new products. Humans, however, can incorporate these novel factors in their judgments. The composite — or average of human judgments and statistical models—proved to be more accurate than either the statistical models or the managers working alone."

In play, away from adults, children really do have control and can practice asserting it. In free play, children learn to make their own decisions, solve their own problems, create and follow rules, and get along with others as equals rather than as obedient or rebellious subordinates. In active outdoor play, children deliberately dose themselves with moderate amounts of fear and they thereby learn how to control not only their bodies, but also their fear. In social play children learn how to negotiate with others, how to please others, and how to manage and overcome the anger that can arise from conflicts. None of these lessons can be taught through verbal means; they can be learned only through experience, which free play provides."

Many early dot‐com companies earned most of their revenue from selling advertising space on their Web sites. To boost reported revenue, some sites began exchanging ad space. Company A would put an ad for its Web site on company B's Web site, and company B would put an ad for its Web site on company A's Web site. No money ever changed hands, but each company recorded revenue (for the value of the space that it gave up on its site) and expense (for the value of its ad that it placed on the other company's site). This practice did little to boost net income and resulted in no additional cash inflow — but it did boost reported revenue. This practice was quickly put to an end because accountants felt that it did not meet the criteria of the revenue recognition principle."

A virtual world's ability to fulfill needs grows when lots and lots of people believe in the world. Conversely, a virtual world cannot be long sustained by a mere handful of adherents. Consider the difference between a global sport and a game I invent with my nine friends and play regularly. My game might be a great game, one that is completely immersive, one that consumes all of my group's time and attention. If its reach is limited to the ten of us, though, then it's ultimately just a weird hobby, and it has limited social function. For a virtual world to provide lasting, wide‐ranging value, its participants must be a large enough group to be considered a society. When that threshold is reached, psychological value can turn into wide‐ranging social value."

It may seem obvious when conditions are 'extreme': the midday heat of a desert, the cold of an Antarctic winter, the salinity of the Great Salt Lake. But this only means that these conditions are extreme for us, given our particular physiological characteristics and tolerances. To a cactus there is nothing extreme about the desert conditions in which cacti have evolved; nor are the icy lands of Antarctica an extreme environment for penguins. It is lazy and dangerous for the ecologist to assume that all other organisms sense the environment in the way we do. Rather, the ecologist should try to gain a worm's‐eye or plant's‐eye view of the environment: to see the world as others see it. Emotive words like harsh and benign, even relativities such as hot and cold, should be used by ecologists only with care."

A process is rational if it always does the right thing based on the current information, given an ideal performance measure. In short, rational processes go by the book and assume that the book is actually correct. Human processes involve instinct, intuition, and other variables that don't necessarily reflect the book and may not even consider the existing data. As an example, the rational way to drive a car is to always follow the laws. However, traffic isn't rational; if you follow the laws precisely, you end up stuck somewhere because other drivers aren't following the laws precisely. To be successful, a self‐driving car must therefore act humanly, rather than rationally."

When you get toward the ""hard"" end of the spectrum, note the language you hear — breaking bad habits and battling addiction. It's as if an unwanted behavior is a nefarious villain to be aggressively defeated. But this kind of language (and the approaches it spawns) frames these challenges in a way that isn't helpful or effective. I specifically hope we will stop using this phrase: ""break a habit."" This language misguides people. The word ""break"" sets the wrong expectation for how you get rid of a bad habit. This word implies that if you input a lot of force in one moment, the habit will be gone. However, that rarely works, because you usually cannot get rid of an unwanted habit by applying force one time."

We cannot get by on reason alone since any reason always eventually leads to a feeling. Should I get a wholegrain cereal or a chocolate cereal? I can list all the reasons I want, but the reasons have to be based on something. For example, if my goal is to eat healthy, I can choose the wholegrain cereal, but what is my reason for wanting to be healthy? I can list more and more reasons such as wanting to live longer, spending more quality time with loved ones, etc., but what are the reasons for those reasons? You should be able to see by now that reasons are ultimately based on non‐reason such as values, feelings, or emotions. These deep‐seated values, feelings, and emotions we have are rarely a result of reasoning, but can certainly be influenced by reasoning. We have values, feelings, and emotions before we begin to reason and long before we begin to reason effectively."

The electric signals are produced in special electric organs. When the signal is discharged the electric organ will be negatively loaded compared to the head and an electric field is created around the fish. A weak electric current is created also in ordinary muscle cells when they contract. In the electric organ the muscle cells are connected in larger chunks, which makes the total current intensity larger than in ordinary muscles. The fish varies the signals by changing the form of the electric field or the frequency of discharging. The system is only working over small distances, about one to two meters. This is an advantage since the species using the signal system often live in large groups with several other species. If many fish send out signals at the same time, the short range decreases the risk of interference."

Creativity leads some individuals to recognize problems that others do not see, but which may be very difficult. Charles Darwin's approach to the speciation problem is a good example of this; he chose a very difficult and tangled problem, speciation, which led him into a long period of data collection and deliberation. This choice of problem did not allow for a quick attack or a simple experiment. In such cases creativity may actually decrease productivity (as measured by publication counts) because effort is focused on difficult problems. For others, whose creativity is more focused on methods and technique, creativity may lead to solutions that drastically reduce the work necessary to solve a problem. We can see an example in the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which enables us to amplify small pieces of DNA in a short time. This type of creativity might reduce the number of steps or substitute steps that are less likely to fail, thus increasing productivity."

But that same child may have no difficulty in determining the directions of up and down or back and front. Scientists propose that this occurs because, although we experience three dimensions, only two had a strong influence on our evolution: the vertical dimension as defined by gravity and, in mobile species, the front/back dimension as defined by the positioning of sensory and feeding mechanisms. These influence our perception of vertical versus horizontal, far versus close, and the search for dangers from above (such as an eagle) or below (such as a snake). However, the left‐right axis is not as relevant in nature. A bear is equally dangerous from its left or the right side, but not if it is upside down. In fact, when observing a scene containing plants, animals, and man‐made objects such as cars or street signs, we can only tell when left and right have been inverted if we observe those artificial items."

""Jack, your son is here,"" the nurse said to an old man lying on the bed. She had to repeat the words several times before the old man's eyes opened. Suffering from the severe pain because of heart disease, he barely saw the young uniformed soldier standing next to him. He reached out his hand to the soldier.
The soldier gently wrapped his fingers around the weak hand of the old man. The nurse brought a chair so that the soldier could sit beside the bed. All through the night the young soldier sat there, holding the old man's hand and offering him words of support and comfort. Occasionally, she suggested that the soldier take a rest for a while. He politely said no.
Whenever the nurse came into the room, she heard the soldier say a few gentle words. The old man said nothing, only held tightly to him all through the night. Just before dawn, the old man died. The soldier released the old man's hand and left the room to find the nurse. After she was told what happened, she went back to the room with him. The soldier hesitated for a while and asked, ""Who was this man?""
She was surprised and asked, ""Wasn't he your father?"" ""No, he wasn't. I've never met him before,"" the soldier replied. She asked, ""Then why didn't you say something when I took you to him?"" He said, ""I knew there had been a mistake, but when I realized that he was too sick to tell whether or not I was his son, I could see how much he needed me. So, I stayed."""

Hundreds of millions of humans today work at jobs they hate, producing things they have no love for. Sometimes these jobs cause physical pain, disability, or chronic disease. Technology creates many new jobs that are certainly dangerous. At the same time, mass education and media train humans to avoid low-tech physical work, to seek jobs working in the digital world. The divorce of the hands from the head puts a stress on the human mind. Indeed, the sedentary nature of the best-paying jobs is a health risk — for body and mind."

With the railways came many large hotels.

Give attention also to fitting the task to the available time. There are some tasks that you can only set about if you have a significant amount of time available.

This forced business to develop closer relations with buyers and clients, which in turn made business realize that it was not enough to produce a quality product at a reasonable price. In fact, it was equally essential to deliver products that customers actually wanted. Henry Ford produced his best-selling T-model Ford in one color only (black) in 1908, but in modern societies this was no longer possible. The modernization of society led to a marketing revolution that destroyed the view that production would create its own demand. Customers, and the desire to meet their diverse and often complex needs, became the focus of business."

Generally, it's easier to fly westward and lengthen your day than it is to fly east-ward and shorten it. This east-west difference in jet lag is sizable enough to have an impact on the performance of sports teams. Studies have found that teams flying westward perform significantly better than teams flying eastward in professional baseball and college football. A more recent study of more than 46,000 Major League Baseball games found additional evidence that eastward travel is tougher than westward travel."

The guards soon came to their senses, went in, and shouted at the monster, demanding that he get off the throne.
With each bad word the guards used, the monster grew more ugly and smelly. The guards got even angrier — they began to brandish their swords to scare the monster away from the palace. But he just grew bigger and bigger, eventually taking up the whole room. He grew more ugly and smelly than ever.
Eventually the king returned. He was wise and kind and saw what was happening. He knew what to do. He smiled and said to the monster, ""Welcome to my palace!"" He asked the monster if he wanted a cup of coffee. The monster began to grow smaller as he drank the coffee.
The king offered him some take-out pizza and fries. The guards immediately called for pizza. The monster continued to get smaller with the king's kind gestures. He then offered the monster a full body massage. As the guards helped with the relaxing massage, the monster became tiny. With another act of kindness to the monster, he just disappeared."

They run and they run, but then Alice discovers that they're still under the same tree that they started from. The Red Queen explains to Alice: ""here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place."" Biologists sometimes use this Red Queen Effect to explain an evolutionary principle. If foxes evolve to run faster so they can catch more rabbits, then only the fastest rabbits will live long enough to make a new generation of bunnies that run even faster—in which case, of course, only the fastest foxes will catch enough rabbits to thrive and pass on their genes. Even though they might run, the two species just stay in place."

Long before the idea was turned into a physical reality, the mind had clearly pictured the finished product. The human being designs his or her own future through much the same process. We begin with an idea about how the future will be. Over a period of time we refine and perfect the vision.

Once people began farming, they could settle down near their farms. As a result, towns and villages grew larger. Living in communities allowed people to organize themselves more efficiently. They could divide up the work of producing food and other things they needed. While some workers grew crops, others built new houses and made tools. Village dwellers also learned to work together to do a task faster. For example, toolmakers could share the work of making stone axes and knives.

For example, hot melted rock material, called magma, cools when it reaches the Earth's surface, or even if it's trapped below the surface. As magma cools, its atoms lose heat energy, move closer together, and begin to combine into compounds. During this process, atoms of the different compounds arrange themselves into orderly, repeating patterns. The type and amount of elements present in a magma partly determine which minerals will form. Also, the size of the crystals that form depends partly on how rapidly the magma cools. When magma cools slowly, the crystals that form are generally large enough to see with the unaided eye. This is because the atoms have enough time to move together and form into larger crystals. When magma cools rapidly, the crystals that form will be small. In such cases, you can't easily see individual mineral crystals."

Complex carbohydrates are the good carbohydrates for your body. These complex sugar compounds are very difficult to break down and can trap other nutrients like vitamins and minerals in their chains. As they slowly break down, the other nutrients are also released into your body, and can provide you with fuel for a number of hours. Bad carbohydrates, on the other hand, are simple sugars. Because their structure is not complex, they are easy to break down and hold few nutrients for your body other than the sugars from which they are made. Your body breaks down these carbohydrates rather quickly and what it cannot use is converted to fat and stored in the body."

In one study, university students were given descriptions of a guest lecturer before he spoke to the group. Half the students received a description containing the word 'warm', the other half were told the speaker was 'cold'. The guest lecturer then led a discussion, after which the students were asked to give their impressions of him. As expected, there were large differences between the impressions formed by the students, depending upon their original information of the lecturer. It was also found that those students who expected the lecturer to be warm tended to interact with him more.

Good question. By understanding post-purchase behavior, you can understand the influence and the likelihood of whether a buyer will repurchase the product (and whether she will keep it or return it). You'll also determine whether the buyer will encourage others to purchase the product from you. Satisfied customers can become unpaid ambassadors for your business, so customer satisfaction should be on the top of your to-do list. People tend to believe the opinions of people they know. People trust friends over advertisements any day. They know that advertisements are paid to tell the ""good side"" and that they're used to persuade them to purchase products and services.

However, richer economies have their own distinct stresses. The key issue is time pressure. A 1999 study of 31 countries by American psychologist Robert Levine and Canadian psychologist Ara Norenzayan found that wealthier, more industrialized nations had a faster pace of life — which led to a higher standard of living, but at the same time left the population feeling a constant sense of urgency, as well as being more prone to heart disease. In effect, fast-paced productivity creates wealth, but it also leads people to feel time-poor when they lack the time to relax and enjoy themselves."

Preschoolers believe what their parents tell them in a very profound way. They do not yet have the cognitive sophistication to reason analytically and reject false information. If a preschool boy consistently hears from his mother that he is smart and a good helper, he is likely to incorporate that information into his self-image. Thinking of himself as a boy who is smart and knows how to do things is likely to make him endure longer in problem-solving efforts and increase his confidence in trying new and difficult tasks. Similarly, thinking of himself as the kind of boy who is a good helper will make him more likely to volunteer to help with tasks at home and at preschool."

Fleischmann's yeast, for instance, was used as an ingredient for cooking homemade bread. Yet more and more people in the early 20th century were buying their bread from stores or bakeries, so consumer demand for yeast decreased. The producer of Fleischmann's yeast hired the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency to come up with a different marketing strategy to boost sales. No longer the ""Soul of Bread,"" the Thompson agency first turned yeast into an important source of vitamins with significant health benefits. Shortly thereafter, the advertising agency transformed yeast into a natural laxative. Repositioning yeast helped increase sales."

Think about a world-famous basketball player. He has made more money from endorsements than he ever did playing basketball. Is it because of his knowledge of the products he endorses? No. It's because of what he can do with a basketball. The same can be said of an Olympic medalist swimmer. People listen to him because of what he can do in the pool. And when an actor tells us we should drive a certain car, we don't listen because of his expertise on engines. We listen because we admire his talent. Excellence connects.

If you were to look out over a city and ask ""where is the economy located?"" you'd see there's no good answer to the question. Instead, the economy emerges from the interaction of all the elements ― from the stores and the banks to the merchants and the customers. And so it is with the brain's operation: it doesn't happen in one spot. Just as in a city, no neighborhood of the brain operates in isolation. In brains and in cities, everything emerges from the interaction between residents, at all scales, locally and distantly. Just as trains bring materials and textiles into a city, which become processed into the economy, so the raw electrochemical signals from sensory organs are transported along superhighways of neurons. There the signals undergo processing and transformation into our conscious reality."

As Louis Armstrong sang, ""When you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you."" If copying another's smile makes us feel happy, the emotion of the smiler has been transmitted via our body. Strange as it may sound, this theory states that emotions arise from our bodies. For example, our mood can be improved by simply lifting up the corners of our mouth. If people are asked to bite down on a pencil lengthwise, taking care not to let the pencil touch their lips (thus forcing the mouth into a smile-like shape), they judge cartoons funnier than if they have been asked to frown. The primacy of the body is sometimes summarized in the phrase ""I must be afraid, because I'm running."""

Brian Wansink, Professor of Marketing at Cornell University, investigated the effectiveness of this tactic in 1998. He persuaded three supermarkets in Sioux City, Iowa, to offer Campbell's soup at a small discount: 79 cents rather than 89 cents. The discounted soup was sold in one of three conditions: a control, where there was no limit on the volume of purchases, or two tests, where customers were limited to either four or twelve cans. In the unlimited condition shoppers bought 3.3 cans on average, whereas in the scarce condition, when there was a limit, they bought 5.3 on average. This suggests scarcity encourages sales. The findings are particularly strong because the test took place in a supermarket with genuine shoppers. It didn't rely on claimed data, nor was it held in a laboratory where consumers might behave differently."

This can stop them from doing their work and make them less productive. Introducing new technology can also have a negative impact on production when it causes a change to the production process or requires workers to learn a new system.

There was no need to tell the time because life depended on natural cycles, such as the changing seasons or sunrise and sunset. Gradually more people started to live in larger settlements, and some needed to tell the time. For example, priests wanted to know when to carry out religious ceremonies. This was when people first invented clocks ― devices that show, measure, and keep track of passing time. Clocks have been important ever since. Today, clocks are used for important things such as setting busy airport timetables ― if the time is incorrect, aeroplanes might crash into each other when taking off or landing!"

Adam Smith, writing when the manufacturing industry was new, described a way that production could be made more efficient, known as the ""division of labor."" Making most manufactured goods involves several different processes using different skills. Smith's example was the manufacture of pins: the wire is straightened, sharpened, a head is put on, and then it is polished. One worker could do all these tasks, and make 20 pins in a day. But this work can be divided into its separate processes, with a number of workers each performing one task. Because each worker specializes in one job, he or she can work much faster without changing from one task to another. Now 10 workers can produce thousands of pins in a day — a huge increase in productivity from the 200 they would have produced before."

The proof is in your photo album: Look at a photograph taken of yourself 5 or 10 years ago and you see clear differences between the face in the snapshot and the face in your mirror. If you lived in a world without mirrors for a year and then saw your reflection, you might be surprised by the change.

By the time we are adults, we have fewer questions and more default settings. As Henry James put it, ""Disinterested curiosity is past, the mental grooves and channels set."" The decline in curiosity can be traced in the development of the brain through childhood. Though smaller than the adult brain, the infant brain contains millions more neural connections. The wiring, however, is a mess; the lines of communication between infant neurons are far less efficient than between those in the adult brain. The baby's perception of the world is consequently both intensely rich and wildly disordered. As children absorb more evidence from the world around them, certain possibilities become much more likely and more useful and harden into knowledge or beliefs. The neural pathways that enable those beliefs become faster and more automatic, while the ones that the child doesn't use regularly are pruned away."

Consider the case of an adult who eats only foods thought of as ""good"" ― for example, raw broccoli, apples, orange juice, boiled tofu, and carrots. Although all these foods are nutrient-dense, they do not add up to a healthy diet because they don't supply a wide enough variety of the nutrients we need. Or take the case of the teenager who occasionally eats fried chicken, but otherwise stays away from fried foods. The occasional fried chicken isn't going to knock his or her diet off track. But the person who eats fried foods every day, with few vegetables or fruits, and loads up on supersized soft drinks, candy, and chips for snacks has a bad diet."

Scientists manipulate a variable of interest, and see if there's a difference. At the same time, they attempt to control for the potential effects of all other variables. The importance of controlled experiments in identifying the underlying causes of events cannot be overstated. In the real-uncontrolled-world, variables are often correlated. For example, people who take vitamin supplements may have different eating and exercise habits than people who don't take vitamins. As a result, if we want to study the health effects of vitamins, we can't merely observe the real world, since any of these factors (the vitamins, diet, or exercise) may affect health. Rather, we have to create a situation that doesn't actually occur in the real world. That's just what scientific experiments do. They try to separate the naturally occurring relationship in the world by manipulating one specific variable at a time, while holding everything else constant."

This is the case whenever questionnaires, interviews, or personality inventories are used to measure variables. Self-report methods can be quite useful. They take advantage of the fact that people have a unique opportunity to observe themselves full-time. However, self-reports can be plagued by several kinds of distortion. One of the most problematic of these distortions is the social desirability bias, which is a tendency to give socially approved answers to questions about oneself. Subjects who are influenced by this bias work overtime trying to create a favorable impression, especially when subjects are asked about sensitive issues. For example, many survey respondents will report that they voted in an election or gave to a charity when in fact it is possible to determine that they did not."

Nontariff trade measures, such as quotas, subsidies, and restrictions on exports, are increasingly prevalent and may be enacted for policy reasons having nothing to do with trade. However, they have a discriminatory effect on exports from countries that lack the resources to comply with requirements of nontariff measures imposed by rich nations. For example, the huge subsidies that wealthy nations give to their farmers make it very difficult for farmers in the rest of the world to compete with them. Another example would be domestic health or safety regulations, which, though not specifically targeting imports, could impose significant costs on foreign manufacturers seeking to conform to the importer's market. Industries in developing markets may have more difficulty absorbing these additional costs."

He also discovered that the stricter regulations were prompting more innovation than the weaker ones. The Dutch flower industry provides an illustration. For many years, the companies producing Holland's world-renowned tulips and other cut flowers were also contaminating the country's water and soil with fertilizers and pesticides. In 1991, the Dutch government adopted a policy designed to cut pesticide use in half by 2000 ― a goal they ultimately achieved. Facing increasingly strict regulation, greenhouse growers realized they had to develop new methods if they were going to maintain product quality with fewer pesticides. In response, they shifted to a cultivation method that circulates water in closed-loop systems and grows flowers in a rock wool substrate. The new system not only reduced the pollution released into the environment; it also increased profits by giving companies greater control over growing conditions."

Two researchers once did a study in which they asked people how much they would pay for data recovery. They found that people would pay a little more for a greater quantity of rescued data, but what they were most sensitive to was the number of hours the technician worked. When the data recovery took only a few minutes, willingness to pay was low, but when it took more than a week to recover the same amount of data, people were willing to pay much more. Think about it: They were willing to pay more for the slower service with the same outcome. Fundamentally, when we value effort over outcome, we're paying for incompetence.

We became entranced by the novel ideas in the book, and because we were so open to influence, these early encounters with exciting ideas sank deeply into our minds and became part of our own thought processes, affecting us decades after we absorbed them. Such influences enriched our mental landscape, and in fact our intelligence depends on the ability to absorb the lessons and ideas of those who are older and wiser. Just as the body tightens with age, however, so does the mind. And just as our sense of weakness and vulnerability motivated the desire to learn, so does our creeping sense of superiority slowly close us off to new ideas and influences. Some may advocate that we all become more skeptical in the modern world, but in fact a far greater danger comes from the increasing closing of the mind that burdens us as individuals as we get older, and seems to be burdening our culture in general."

Popular thinking said the earth was the center of the universe, yet Copernicus studied the stars and planets and proved mathematically that the earth and the other planets in our solar system revolved around the sun. Popular thinking said surgery didn't require clean instruments, yet Joseph Lister studied the high death rates in hospitals and introduced antiseptic practices that immediately saved lives. Popular thinking said that women shouldn't have the right to vote, yet people like Emmeline Pankhurst and Susan B. Anthony fought for and won that right.

In fact, fewer than 50 percent of the people who sign up for taxi driver training pass the test, even after spending two or three years studying for it! And as it turns out, the brains of London cabbies are different from non-cab-driving humans in ways that reflect their herculean memory efforts.

Economists often refer to this situation as The Law of Unintended Consequences. For instance, suppose that you impose a tariff on imported steel in order to protect the jobs of domestic steelworkers. If you impose a high enough tariff, their jobs will indeed be protected from competition by foreign steel companies. But an unintended consequence is that the jobs of some autoworkers will be lost to foreign competition. Why? The tariff that protects steelworkers raises the price of the steel that domestic automobile makers need to build their cars. As a result, domestic automobile manufacturers have to raise the prices of their cars, making them relatively less attractive than foreign cars. Raising prices tends to reduce domestic car sales, so some domestic autoworkers lose their jobs."

One example is the brilliantly colored golden toad once found only in a small area of lush rain forests in Costa Rica's mountainous region. Despite living in the country's well-protected Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, by 1989, the golden toad had apparently become extinct. Much of the moisture that supported its rain forest habitat came in the form of moisture-laden clouds blowing in from the Caribbean Sea. But warmer air from global climate change caused these clouds to rise, depriving the forests of moisture, and the habitat for the golden toad and many other species dried up. The golden toad appears to be one of the first victims of climate change caused largely by global warming."

Participants in a study were asked to fixate on various products moving across a large computer screen and then indicate whether the items appealed to them. Some of the items moved vertically (causing the participants to nod their heads while watching), and others moved horizontally (resulting in a side-to-side head movement).

However, development of creative ability in one domain may enhance effectiveness in other domains that require similar skills, and flexible switching between generality and specificity is helpful to productivity in many domains. Excessive specificity may result in information from outside the domain being underestimated and unavailable, which leads to fixedness of thinking, whereas excessive generality causes chaos, vagueness, and shallowness. Both tendencies pose a threat to the transfer of knowledge and skills between domains. What should therefore be optimal for the development of cross-domain creativity is support for young people in taking up creative challenges in a specific domain and coupling it with encouragement to apply knowledge and skills in, as well as from, other domains, disciplines, and tasks."

When you say It's mine in reference to a resource, often that means you own a lot of the sticks that make up the full bundle: the sell stick, the rent stick, the right to mortgage, license, give away, even destroy the thing. Often, though, we split the sticks up, as for a piece of land: there may be a landowner, a bank with a mortgage, a tenant with a lease, a plumber with a license to enter the land, an oil company with mineral rights.

Typically it's to our natural instinct when we meet someone coming down a sidewalk to place yourself in some manner of protective position, especially when they introduce themselves as having known you, much to your surprise. By design, we set up challenges in which the individual must validate how they know us by presenting scenarios, names or acquaintances, or evidence by which to validate (that is, photographs). Once we have received that information and it has gone through a cognitive validation, we accept that person as more trustworthy.

In an era when museums are forced to increase their earnings, they often focus their energies on modernising their galleries or mounting temporary exhibitions to bring more and more audiences through the door. In other words, as museums struggle to survive in a competitive economy, their budgets often prioritise those parts of themselves that are consumable: infotainment in the galleries, goods and services in the cafes and the shops. The unlit, unglamorous storerooms, if they are ever discussed, are at best presented as service areas that process objects for the exhibition halls. And at worst, as museums pour more and more resources into their publicly visible faces, the spaces of storage may even suffer, their modernisation being kept on hold or being given less and less space to house the expanding collections and serve their complex conservation needs."

A rational agent should be autonomous ― it should learn what it can to compensate for partial or incorrect prior knowledge. For example, a vacuum-cleaning agent that learns to foresee where and when additional dirt will appear will do better than one that does not. As a practical matter, one seldom requires complete autonomy from the start: when the agent has had little or no experience, it would have to act randomly unless the designer gave some assistance. So, just as evolution provides animals with enough built-in reflexes to survive long enough to learn for themselves, it would be reasonable to provide an artificial intelligent agent with some initial knowledge as well as an ability to learn. After sufficient experience of its environment, the behavior of a rational agent can become effectively independent of its prior knowledge. Hence, the incorporation of learning allows one to design a single rational agent that will succeed in a vast variety of environments."

Consumption is becoming progressively less determined by the need for sustenance and the practical use of the goods consumed.

People pay a premium to eat exotic cuisines that provide an interesting experience or that symbolize a distinctive life-style.

The group has a sense of moral community based on years of trust and sharing. In a certain community of North America, labor sharing is a major economic factor of social cohesion. When a family needs a new barn or faces repair work that requires group labor, a barn-raising party is called. Many families show up to help. Adult men provide manual labor, and adult women provide food for the event. Later, when another family needs help, they call on the same people."

If so, how? The scientific thinker looks for features of the thing that can be stripped of subjectivity ― ideally, those aspects that can be quantified and whose values will thus never change from one observer to the next. In this way, he arrives at a reality independent of all observers. The artist, on the other hand, relies on the strength of her artistry to effect a marriage between her own subjectivity and that of her readers. To a scientific thinker, this must sound like magical thinking: you're saying you will imagine something so hard it'll pop into someone else's head exactly the way you envision it? The artist has sought the opposite of the scientist's observer-independent reality. She creates a reality dependent upon observers, indeed a reality in which human beings must participate in order for it to exist at all."

Since Plato, the supremacy of rational reason is based on the assertion that it is able to extract true knowledge from experience. As the discussion in the Republic helps to explain, perceptions are inherently unreliable and misleading because the senses are subject to errors and illusions. Only the rational discourse has the tools to overcome illusions and to point towards true knowledge. For instance, perception suggests that a figure in the distance is smaller than it really is. Yet, the application of logical reasoning will reveal that the figure only appears small because it obeys the laws of geometrical perspective. Nevertheless, even after the perspectival correction is applied and reason concludes that perception is misleading, the figure still appears small, and the truth of the matter is revealed not in the perception of the f igure but in its rational representation."

Because experts have extensive practice within a limited domain, the key component skills in their domain tend to be highly practiced and more automated. Each of these highly practiced skills then demands relatively few cognitive resources, effectively lowering the total cognitive load that experts experience. Thus, experts can perform complex tasks and combine multiple tasks relatively easily. This is not because they necessarily have more cognitive resources than beginners; rather, because of the high level of fluency they have achieved in performing key skills, they can do more with what they have. Beginners, on the other hand, have not achieved the same degree of fluency and automaticity in each of the component skills, and thus they struggle to combine skills that experts combine with relative ease and efficiency."

Physical things are increasingly becoming information technologies. Cars are ""computers we ride in,"" and airplanes are nothing more than ""flying Solaris boxes attached to bucketfuls of industrial control systems."" As all this code grows in size and complexity, so too do the number of errors and software bugs. According to a study by Carnegie Mellon University, commercial software typically has twenty to thirty bugs for every thousand lines of code ― 50 million lines of code means 1 million to 1.5 million potential errors to be exploited. This is the basis for all malware attacks that take advantage of these computer bugs to get the code to do something it was not originally intended to do. As computer code grows more elaborate, software bugs flourish and security suffers, with increasing consequences for society at large."

If we feel awkward, embarrassed or ashamed when we are alone, we don't blush; it seems to be caused by our concern about what others are thinking of us. Studies have confirmed that simply being told you are blushing brings it on. We feel as though others can see through our skin and into our mind. However, while we sometimes want to disappear when we involuntarily go bright red, psychologists argue that blushing actually serves a positive social purpose. When we blush, it's a signal to others that we recognize that a social norm has been broken; it is an apology for a faux pas. Maybe our brief loss of face benefits the long-term cohesion of the group. Interestingly, if someone blushes after making a social mistake, they are viewed in a more favourable light than those who don't blush."

In some cases, this institutionalization has a formal face to it, with rules and protocols written down, and specialized roles created to ensure that procedures are followed correctly. The main institutions of state ― parliament, courts, police and so on ― along with certain of the professions, exhibit this formal character. Other social institutions, perhaps the majority, are not like this; science is an example. Although scientists are trained in the substantive content of their discipline, they are not formally instructed in 'how to be a good scientist'. Instead, much like the young child learning how to play 'nicely', the apprentice scientist gains his or her understanding of the moral values inherent in the role by absorption from their colleagues ― socialization. We think that these values, along with the values that inform many of the professions, are under threat, just as the value of the professions themselves is under threat."

Some individuals photosynthesize like mad until sugar positively bubbles along their trunk. As a result, they are fit and grow better, but they aren't particularly long-lived. This is because a tree can be only as strong as the forest that surrounds it. And there are now a lot of losers in the forest. Weaker members, who would once have been supported by the stronger ones, suddenly fall behind.

It follows that natural selection is unlikely to lead to the evolution of perfect, 'maximally fit' individuals. Rather, organisms come to match their environments by being 'the fittest available' or 'the fittest yet': they are not 'the best imaginable'. Part of the lack of fit arises because the present properties of an organism have not all originated in an environment similar in every respect to the one in which it now lives. Over the course of its evolutionary history, an organism's remote ancestors may have evolved a set of characteristics ― evolutionary 'baggage' ― that subsequently constrain future evolution. For many millions of years, the evolution of vertebrates has been limited to what can be achieved by organisms with a vertebral column. Moreover, much of what we now see as precise matches between an organism and its environment may equally be seen as constraints: koala bears live successfully on Eucalyptus foliage, but, from another perspective, koala bears cannot live without Eucalyptus foliage."

I have an English essay assignment I need to finish."" Her mother persisted, ""Come on! Your father's birthday is just around the corner, and you wanted to buy his birthday present by yourself."" Ellen suddenly realized that her father's birthday was just two days away. So she altered her original plan to do the assignment in the library and decided to go to the shopping mall with her mother.
Upon arrival at the shopping center, her mother inquired, ""Ellen, have you decided what to buy for his birthday present?"" She quickly replied, ""I would like to buy him a pair of soccer shoes."" Ellen knew that her father had joined the morning soccer club recently and needed some new soccer shoes. She entered a shoe store and selected a pair of red soccer shoes. After buying the present, she told her mother, ""Mom, now, I'm going to do my assignment in the cafe while you are shopping.""
Ellen wanted to get a strawberry smoothie in the cafe, but it was sold out. So she bought a yogurt smoothie instead. The cafe was not very busy for a Saturday afternoon, and Ellen settled at a large table to work on her assignment. However, after a while, a group of students came in, and there weren't any large tables left. One of them came over to Ellen's table and politely asked, ""Could you possibly move to that smaller table?"" Ellen replied, ""It's okay. I was just leaving anyway."" She hurriedly gathered her assignment leaving the shoe bag behind under the table.
""It must be in the cafe,"" Ellen suddenly exclaimed when she realized the gift for her father was missing upon returning home. She felt so disheartened, worrying it would be impossible to find it. ""Why don't you call the cafe?"" suggested her mother. When she phoned the cafe and asked about the shoe bag, the manager said that she would check and let her know. After a few minutes, she called back and told Ellen that she had just discovered it. Ellen was so pleased that the birthday gift had been found."

Examination of human remains from early hunter-gatherer societies has suggested that our ancestors enjoyed abundant food, obtainable without excessive effort, and suffered very few diseases. If this is true, it is not clear why so many humans settled in permanent villages and developed agriculture, growing crops and domesticating animals: cultivating fields was hard work, and it was in farming villages that epidemic diseases first took root. Whatever its immediate effect on the lives of humans, the development of settlements and agriculture undoubtedly led to a high increase in population density. This period, known as the New Stone Age, was a major turning point in human development, opening the way to the growth of the first towns and cities, and eventually leading to settled ""civilizations."""

This behavior seems to reveal a preference of a delayed reward over an immediate one: the agent gives up some immediate pleasure in exchange for a future one. Thus the discounted value of the future reward should be greater than the un-discounted value of the present one. However, in some cases the agent does not wait for the envisioned occasion but uses their savings prematurely. For example, early in the year an employee might set aside money to buy Christmas presents but then spend it on a summer vacation instead. Such cases could be examples of weakness of will. That is, the agents may judge or resolve to spend their savings in a certain way for the greatest benefit but then act differently when temptation for immediate pleasure emerges."

For Coleridge, by coincidence, the untimely visitor came at a particularly bad time. He forgot his inspiration and left the work unfinished.

The initial steps are solo. You start by asking everyone to generate ideas separately. Next, you pool them and share them anonymously among the group. To preserve independent judgment, each member evaluates them on their own. Only then does the team come together to select and refine the most promising options. By developing and assessing ideas individually before choosing and elaborating them, teams can surface and advance possibilities that might not get attention otherwise.

One 2010 study at a manufacturing plant in Ohio, for instance, carefully examined assembly-line workers who were empowered to make small decisions about their schedules and work environment. They designed their own uniforms and had authority over shifts while all the manufacturing processes and pay scales stayed the same. Within two months, productivity at the plant increased by 20 percent, with workers taking shorter breaks and making fewer mistakes. Giving employees a sense of control improved how much self-discipline they brought to their jobs."

However, digital business activities can still threaten the environment. In some cases, the harm of digital businesses can be even more hazardous. A few decades ago, offices used to have much more paper waste since all documents were paper based. When workplaces shifted from paper to digital documents, invoices, and emails, it was a promising step to save trees. However, the cost of the Internet and electricity for the environment is neglected. A recent Wired report declared that most data centers' energy source is fossil fuels. When we store bigger data on clouds, increased carbon emissions make our green clouds gray. The carbon footprint of an email is smaller than mail sent via a post office, but still, it causes four grams of CO₂, and it can be as much as 50 grams if the attachment is big."

Britain's red and grey squirrels provide a clear example. When the grey arrived from America in the 1870s, both squirrel species competed for the same food and habitat, which put the native red squirrel populations under pressure. The grey had the edge because it can adapt its diet; it is able, for instance, to eat green acorns, while the red can only digest mature acorns. Within the same area of forest, grey squirrels can destroy the food supply before red squirrels even have a bite. Greys can also live more densely and in varied habitats, so have survived more easily when woodland has been destroyed. As a result, the red squirrel has come close to extinction in England."

Hunter-gatherers typically moved around frequently, and they had to be able to carry all their possessions with them every time they moved. In particular, mothers had to carry their young children. As a result, hunter-gatherer mothers could have only one baby every four years or so, spacing their births so that they never had to carry more than one child at a time. Farmers, on the other hand, could live in the same place year after year and did not have to worry about transporting young children long distances. Societies that settled down in one place were able to shorten their birth intervals from four years to about two. This meant that each woman could have more children than her hunter-gatherer counterpart, which in turn resulted in rapid population growth among farming communities. An increased population was actually an advantage to agricultural societies, because farming required large amounts of human labor."

Without childhood, animals must rely more fully on hardware, and therefore be less flexible. Among migratory bird species, those that are born knowing how, when, and where to migrate — those that are migrating entirely with instructions they were born with — sometimes have very inefficient migration routes. These birds, born knowing how to migrate, don't adapt easily. So when lakes dry up, forest becomes farmland, or climate change pushes breeding grounds farther north, those birds that are born knowing how to migrate keep flying by the old rules and maps. By comparison, birds with the longest childhoods, and those that migrate with their parents, tend to have the most efficient migration routes. Childhood facilitates the passing on of cultural information, and culture can evolve faster than genes. Childhood gives flexibility in a changing world."

While professionals working in educational technology and commercial web design have made significant progress in meeting the needs of such users, some scholars creating digital projects all too often fail to take these needs into account.

It will require ― inevitably ― realizing they are unable to say what they actually think. Worse, it demands that they become a different type of person or do bad things.

This is an example of something known as moral hazard ― when government support alters the decisions firms take. For example, if governments rescue banks who get into difficulty, as they did during the credit crisis of 2007-08, this could encourage banks to take greater risks in the future because they know there is a possibility that governments will intervene if they lose money. Although the government rescue may be well intended, it can negatively affect the behavior of banks, encouraging risky and poor decision making."

The very notion seems nonsensical. But if we're far enough away, an entire sun can go out and we'll continue to see it shining brightly; we won't learn of its death, it may be, for ages to come ― in fact, for how long it takes light, which travels fast but not infinitely fast, to cross the intervening vastness.

What you need to do in that situation is find another way to think about the timeframe. For example, if it's November and the deadline is in January, it's better to tell yourself you have to get it done ""this winter"" rather than ""next year.""

However, smiling in blind babies eventually disappears if nothing is done to reinforce it. Without the right feedback, smiling dies out. But here's a fascinating fact: blind babies will continue to smile if they are cuddled, bounced, nudged, and tickled by an adult ― anything to let them know that they are not alone and that someone cares about them. This social feedback encourages the baby to continue smiling. In this way, early experience operates with our biology to establish social behaviors. In fact, you don't need the cases of blind babies to make the point. Babies with sight smile more at you when you look at them or, better still, smile back at them."

Take commercials. Most people hate them, so removing them should make shows or other entertainment more enjoyable. But the opposite is true. Shows are actually more enjoyable when they're broken up by annoying commercials. Because these less enjoyable moments break up adaptation to the positive experience of the show. Think about eating chocolate chips. The first chip is delicious: sweet, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The second chip is also pretty good. But by the fourth, fifth, or tenth chip in a row, the goodness is no longer as pleasurable. We adapt. Interspersing positive experiences with less positive ones, however, can delay adaptation. Eating a Brussels sprout between chocolate chips or viewing commercials between parts of TV shows disrupts the process.

In one study, students were asked to arrange ten posters in order of attractiveness ― with the agreement that afterward they could keep one poster as a reward for their participation. Five minutes later, they were told that the poster with the third highest rating was no longer available. Then they were asked to judge all ten from scratch. The poster that was no longer available was suddenly classified as the most beautiful.

Giving up would mean acknowledging that we've wasted something we can't get back, and that thought is so painful that we prefer to avoid it if we can. The problem, of course, is that if something really is a bad bet, then staying with it simply increases the amount we lose. Rather than walk away from a bad five-year relationship, for example, we turn it into a bad 10-year relationship; rather than accept that we've lost a thousand dollars, we lay down another thousand and lose that too.

If we lived in an agrarian society, we would have to eat our crops reasonably soon after the harvest or find some way to store them. Financial markets are a more sophisticated way of managing the harvest.

By directing your attention, they perform tricks with their hands in full view. Their actions should give away the game, but they can rest assured that your brain processes only small bits of the visual scene.

As they pushed their grocery cart through the parking lot, they saw a red car pulling into the space next to their pick-up truck. A young man named Greg was driving. ""That's a cool car,"" Ava said to her dad. He agreed and looked at Greg, who finished parking and opened his door.
As Todd finished loading his groceries, Greg's door remained open. Todd noticed Greg didn't get out of his car. But he was pulling something from his car. He put a metal frame on the ground beside his door. Remaining in the driver's seat, he then reached back into his car to grab something else. Todd realized what he was doing and considered whether he should try to help him. After a moment, he decided to approach Greg.
By this time, Greg had already pulled one thin wheel out of his car and attached it to the frame. He was now pulling a second wheel out when he looked up and saw Todd standing near him. Todd said, ""Hi there! Have a great weekend!"" Greg seemed a bit surprised, but replied by wishing him a great weekend too. Then Greg added, ""Thanks for letting me have my independence."" ""Of course,"" Todd said.
After Todd and Ava climbed into their truck, Ava became curious. So she asked why he didn't offer to help the man with his wheelchair. Todd said, ""Why do you insist on brushing your teeth without my help?"" She answered, ""Because I know how to!"" He said, ""And the man knows how to put together his wheelchair."" Ava understood that sometimes the best way to help someone is to not help at all."

Whether it be due to the growing presence of AI assistants or the emergence of self-driving cars, the necessity of the role of humans as the decision makers would appear to be in decline. After all, our capacity for making mistakes is well documented. However, perhaps the saving grace of human determination is to be found here as well. Little evidence exists that suggests modern AI's infallibility or predicts it in the future. It is crucial that, in light of humanity's acceptance of our own fallibility, we utilize our capacity to overcome such failures to position ourselves as the overseers of AI's own growth and applications for the foreseeable future."

In most public discussion of burnout, we talk about workers who ""are burned out,"" as if that status were black and white. A black-and-white view cannot account for the variety of burnout experience, though. If there is a clear line between burned out and not, as there is with a lightbulb, then we have no good way to categorize people who say they are burned out but still manage to do their work competently. Thinking about burnout as a spectrum solves this problem; those who claim burnout but are not debilitated by it are simply dealing with a partial or less-severe form of it. They are experiencing burnout without being burned out. Burnout hasn't had the last word."

The fact that everyone was going to be able to speak and listen had to be accommodated ethically, and it was via a rough egalitarianism. In terms of communications, people were equal and therefore it was believed they should be equal, or at least relatively so. By this code, ancient Big Men were not allowed to act controllingly and modern office managers are not allowed to silence anyone at will. Moreover, equal access to speech and hearing promoted the notion that property should be held in common, that goods and food in particular should be shared, and that everyone had a duty to take care of everyone else. This was probably more true among hunter-gatherers than it is in the modern family, circle of friends, or workplace. But even in these cases we believe that sharing and mutual aid are right and proper. Remember, if you bring something, you should bring enough for everyone."

A few thousand years ago ancient Egyptian and then ancient Greek art presented human forms in shadow-style silhouette. But cast shadows do not appear in Western art until about 400 BCE in Athens. It was only after shadows had become an established, if controversial, part of representation that classical writers claimed that art itself had begun with the tracing of a human shadow. Greeks and Romans were the first to make the transition from modeling shadows to cast shadows, a practice that implied a consistent light source, a fixed point of view, and an understanding of geometric projection. In fact, what we might now call ""shadow studies"" ― the exploration of shadows in their various artistic representations ― has its roots in ancient Athens. Ever since, the practice of portraying shadows has evolved along with critical analysis of them, as artists and theoreticians have engaged in an ongoing debate about the significance of shadow representation."

One answer comes from the psychologist R. A. Bjork's concept of desirable difficulty. More difficult retrieval leads to better learning, provided the act of retrieval is itself successful. Free recall tests, in which students need to recall as much as they can remember without prompting, tend to result in better retention than cued recall tests, in which students are given hints about what they need to remember. Cued recall tests, in turn, are better than recognition tests, such as multiple-choice answers, where the correct answer needs to be recognized but not generated. Giving someone a test immediately after they learn something improves retention less than giving them a slight delay, long enough so that answers aren't in mind when they need them. Difficulty, far from being a barrier to making retrieval work, may be part of the reason it does so."

Contexts that use controlling strategies such as salient rewards and punishments or evaluative, selfesteem-hooking pressures are least likely to lead people to value activities as their own. This is not to say that controls don't work to produce behavior ― decades of operant psychology prove that they can. It is rather that the more salient the external control over a person's behavior, the more the person is likely to be merely externally regulated or introjected in his or her actions. Consequently, the person does not develop a value or investment in the behaviors, but instead remains dependent on external controls. Thus, parents who reward, force, or cajole their child to do homework are more likely to have a child who does so only when rewarded, cajoled, or forced. The salience of external controls weakens the acquisition of self-responsibility. Alternatively, parents who supply reasons, show an emotional understanding of difficulties overcoming problems, and use a minimum of external incentives are more likely to cultivate a sense of willingness and value for work in their child."

This is clear in the analog environment where the information content is inextricably fixed to the physical medium. In the digital environment, the medium is not part of the message. A bit stream looks the same to a computer regardless of the media it is read from. A physical carrier is necessary, but as long as the source media can be read, bit-perfect copies can be made cheaply and easily on other devices, making the preservation of the original carrier of diminishing importance. As the physical media that carry digital information are quite delicate relative to most analog media, it is expected that digital information will necessarily need to be migrated from one physical carrier to another as part of the ongoing preservation process. It is not the media itself but the information on the media that needs to be preserved."

Ideas that are original but not useful are irrelevant, and ideas that are useful but not original are unremarkable. While this definition is widely used in research, an important aspect of creativity is often ignored: Generating creative ideas rarely is the final goal. Rather, to successfully solve problems or innovate requires one or a few good ideas that really work, and work better than previous approaches. This requires that people evaluate the products of their own or each other's imagination, and choose those ideas that seem promising enough to develop further, and abandon those that are unlikely to be successful. Thus, being creative does not stop with idea generation. In fact, the ability to generate creative ideas is essentially useless if these ideas subsequently die a silent death."

For example, performance evaluation and reward systems that reinforce long-term performance and the development and sharing of new skills and knowledge are particularly important. In addition, the human resource development function may be dramatically changed to keep the emphasis on continuous learning. In a learning organization, every employee must take the responsibility for acquiring and transferring knowledge. Formal training programs, developed in advance and delivered according to a preset schedule, are insufficient to address shifting training needs and encourage timely information sharing. Rather, human resource development professionals must become learning facilitators. Their role should be to assist, consult, and advise teams on how best to approach learning. They must be able to develop new mechanisms for cross-training peers ― team members ― and new systems for capturing and sharing information. To do this, human resource development professionals must be able to think systematically and understand how to promote learning within groups and across the organization."

This coupled system can be seen as a complete cognitive system of its own. In this manner, subjective experience is extended into the external environment and vice versa; the external environment with its disciplinary objects such as institutional laws and equipment becomes mental institutions that affect our subjective experience and solutions. A subjectively held belief attains the status of objectivity when the belief is socially shared. That is, even if we are trained as hard-nosed health care rationalists, or no-nonsense bureaucrats, or data-driven scientists, research has shown that our decisions are influenced by various institutional practices. They include bureaucratic structures and procedures, the architectural design of health care institutions, the rules of evidence and the structure of allowable questions in a courtroom trial, the spatial arrangement of kindergartens and supermarkets, and a variety of conventions and practices designed to manipulate our emotions."

With regard to models of perception, the question arises of whose perception we are trying to model ― even if we confine ourselves to a particular culture and historical environment. Surely the perception of music varies greatly between listeners of different levels of training; indeed, a large part of music education is devoted to developing and enriching (and therefore likely changing) these listening processes. While this may be true, I am concerned here with fairly basic aspects of perception ― particularly meter and key ― which I believe are relatively consistent across listeners. Anecdotal evidence suggests, for example, that most people are able to ''find the beat'' in a typical folk song or classical piece. This is not to say that there is complete uniformity in this regard ― there may be occasional disagreements, even among experts, as to how we hear the tonality or meter of a piece. But I believe the commonalities between us far outweigh the differences."

In some species these two events overlap, but in others memorization can occur before practice by several months, providing an impressive example of long-term memory storage. The young bird's initial efforts to reproduce the memorized song are usually not successful. These early songs may have uneven pitch, irregular tempo, and notes that are out of order or poorly reproduced. However, sound graphs of songs recorded over several weeks or months reveal that during this practice period the bird fine-tunes his efforts until he produces an accurate copy of the memorized template. This process requires hearing oneself sing; birds are unable to reproduce memorized songs if they are deafened after memorization but before the practice period."

The intentional setting of fire to manage the landscape was practised by Aboriginal people for millennia. However, the pattern of burning that stockmen introduced was unlike previous regimes. When conditions allowed, they would set fire to the landscape as they moved their animals out for the winter. This functioned to clear woody vegetation and also stimulated new plant growth in the following spring. The young shoots were a ready food source for their animals when they returned. However, the practice also tended to reinforce the scrubby growth it was intended to control. Although grasses were the first kinds of plants to recolonize the burnt areas they were soon succeeded by further woody plants and shrubs. About the only strategy to prevent such regrowth was further burning ― essentially using fire to control the consequences of using fire."

If a firm pollutes more, it pays additional tax directly in proportion to the rise in emissions. The polluter thus has an incentive to reduce emissions in any manner that is less costly per unit of abatement than the tax on each unit of residual emissions. The great attraction of basing the tax directly on measured emissions is that the actions the polluter can take to reduce tax liability are actions that also reduce emissions. Continuous emissions measurement can be costly, particularly where there are many separate sources of emissions, and for many pollution problems this may be a major disincentive to direct taxation of emissions. Nevertheless, the technologies available for monitoring the concentrations and flows of particular substances in waste discharges have been developing rapidly. In the future, it may be possible to think of taxing measured emissions in a wider range of applications."

Feelings of pleasure and uncertainty carry the viewer along to the conclusion of the piece. In highly expressionist works, novel stylistic devices work in an inharmonious manner against the subject matter thereby creating a disquieting atmosphere. Thus, when the work is less ""readable"" (or easily interpreted), its departure from conventional forms reminds the viewer or reader that an ""aesthetic attitude"" is needed to appreciate the whole episode. This active involvement provides a basis for depth of aesthetic processing and reflection on the meaning of the work.

The potential contribution of greater economic success, if it involves vulnerable groups, cannot be denied. At the same time, it is important to recognize that, no matter how fast they grow, countries where a large part of the population derive their livelihood from uncertain sources cannot hope to prevent famines without specialized entitlement protection mechanisms involving direct public intervention. Rapid growth of the economy in Botswana, or of the agricultural sector in Kenya, or of food production in Zimbabwe, explains at best only a small part of their success in preventing recurrent threats of famine.

This form of ethics is distinct from higher levels of conceptual ethics or theory. The nature of an ethical issue or problem from this perspective is that there is no clear right or wrong response. It is therefore essential that students learn to think through ethical issues rather than follow a prescribed set of ethical codes or rules. There is a need to vary recognition that, although being ethical is defined as acting 'in accordance with the principles of conduct that are considered correct', these principles vary both between and within individuals. What a person values relates to their social, religious, or civic beliefs influenced by their formal and informal learning experiences. Individual perspectives may also be context dependent, meaning that under different circumstances, at a different time, when they are feeling a different way, the same individual may make different choices. Therefore, in order to analyse ethical issues and think ethically it is necessary to understand the personal factors that influence your own 'code of behaviour' and how these may coincide, alongside recognizing and accepting that the factors that drive other people's codes and decision making may be different."
